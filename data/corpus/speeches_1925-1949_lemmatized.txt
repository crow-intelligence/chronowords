result of the great conflict many of its burden will bear heavily upon we for year and the secondaryand indirect effect we must expect to experience for some time but weare begin to comprehend more definitely what course should be pursue what remedy ought to be apply what action should be take for ourdeliverance and be clearly manifest a determined will faithfully andconscientiously to adopt these method of relief already we have sufficientlyrearrange our domestic affair so that confidence have return businesshas revive and we appear to be enter an era of prosperity which isgradually

disputesamong the european nation because of what america be and what americahas do a firm courage a high hope inspire the heart of all humanity these result have not occur by mere chance they have be securedby a constant and enlightened effort mark by many sacrifice and extendingover many generation we can not continue these brilliant success inthe future unless we continue to learn from the past it be necessaryto keep the former experience of our country both at home and abroad continuallybefore we if we be to have any science of government if we wish to erectnew structure we must have a definite knowledge of the old foundation we must realize that human nature be about the most constant thing in theuniverse and that the essential of human relationship do not change wemust frequently take our bearing from these fix star of our politicalfirmament if we expect to hold a true course if we examine carefully whatwe have do we can determine the more accurately what we can do we stand at the opening of the one hundred and fiftieth year since ournational consciousness first assert itself by unmistakable action withan array of force the old sentiment of detached and dependent coloniesdisappeare in the new sentiment of a united and independent nation menbegan to discard the narrow confine of a local charter for the broaderopportunitie of a national constitution under the eternal urge of freedomwe become an independent nation a little less than 50 year later thatfreedom and independence be reassert in the face of all the world and guard support and secure by the monroe doctrine the narrowfringe of states along the atlantic seaboard advance its frontier acrossthe hill and plain of an intervene continent until it pass down thegolden slope to the pacific we make freedom a birthright we extendedour domain over distant island in order to safeguard our own interestsand accept the consequent obligation to bestow justice and liberty uponless favor people in the defense of our own ideal and in the generalcause of liberty we enter the great war when victory have be fullysecure we withdraw to our own shore unrecompense save in the consciousnessof duty do throughout all these experience we have enlarge our freedom we havestrengthene our independence we have be and propose to be more andmore american we believe that we can well serve our own country and mostsuccessfully discharge our obligation to humanity by continue to beopenly and candidly in tensely and scrupulously american if we haveany heritage it have be that if we have any destiny we have find itin that direction but if we wish to continue to be distinctively american we must continueto make that term comprehensive enough to embrace the legitimate desiresof a civilized and enlightened people determine in all their relationsto pursue a conscientious and religious life we can not permit ourselvesto be narrow and dwarf by slogan and phrase it be not the adjective but the substantive which be of real importance it be not the name ofthe action but the result of the action which be the chief concern itwill be well not to be too much disturb by the thought of either isolationor entanglement of pacifist and militarist the physical configurationof the earth have separate we from all of the old world but the commonbrotherhood of man the high law of all our being have unite we byinseparable bond with all humanity our country represent nothing butpeaceful intention toward all the earth but it ought not to fail to maintainsuch a military force as comport with the dignity and security of a greatpeople it ought to be a balanced force intensely modem capable of defenseby sea and land beneath the surface and in the air but it should be soconducte that all the world may see in it not a menace but an instrumentof security and peace this nation believe thoroughly in an honorable peace under which theright of its citizen be to be everywhere protect it have never foundthat the necessary enjoyment of such a peace could be maintain only bya great and threaten array of arm in common with other nation itis now more determined than ever to promote peace through friendlinessand good will through mutual understanding and mutual forbearance wehave never practice the policy of competitive armament we have recentlycommitte ourselves by covenant with the other great nation to a limitationof our sea power as one result of this our navy rank large in comparison than it ever do before remove the burden of expense and jealousy whichmust always accrue from a keen rivalry be one of the most effective methodsof diminish that unreasonable hysteria and misunderstanding which arethe most potent mean of foment war this policy represent a new departurein the world it be a thought an ideal which have lead to an entirely newline of action it will not be easy to maintain some never move fromtheir old position some be constantly slip back to the old waysof thought and the old action of seize a musket and rely on force america have take the lead in this new direction and that lead americamust continue to hold if we expect other to rely on our fairness andjustice we must show that we rely on their fairness and justice if we be to judge by past experience there be much to be hope forin international relation from frequent conference and consultation we have before we the beneficial result of the washington conference andthe various consultation recently hold upon european affair some ofwhich be in response to our suggestion and in some of which we wereactive participant even the failure can not but be account usefuland an immeasurable advance over threatened or actual warfare i be stronglyin favor of continuation of this policy whenever condition be such thatthere be even a promise that practical and favorable result might be secure in conformity with the principle that a display of reason rather thana threat of force should be the determine factor in the intercourse amongnation we have long advocate the peaceful settlement of dispute bymethod of arbitration and have negotiate many treaty to secure thatresult the same consideration should lead to our adherence to the permanentcourt of international justice where great principle be involve wheregreat movement be under way which promise much for the welfare of humanityby reason of the very fact that many other nation have give such movementstheir actual support we ought not to withhold our own sanction becauseof any small and inessential difference but only upon the ground of themost important and compelling fundamental reason we can not barter awayour independence or our sovereignty but we ought to engage in no refinementsof logic no sophistry and no subterfuge to argue away the undoubtedduty of this country by reason of the might of its number the power ofit resource and its position of leadership in the world actively andcomprehensively to signify its approval and to bear its full share of theresponsibility of a candid and disinterested attempt at the establishmentof a tribunal for the administration of even hand justice between nationand nation the weight of our enormous influence must be cast upon theside of a reign not of force but of law and trial not by battle but byreason we have never any wish to interfere in the political condition of anyother country especially be we determined not to become implicatedin the political controversy of the old world with a great deal of hesitation we have respond to appeal for help to maintain order protect life andproperty and establish responsible government in some of the small countriesof the western hemisphere our private citizen have advance large sumsof money to assist in the necessary financing and relief of the old world we have not fail nor shall we fail to respond whenever necessary tomitigate human suffering and assist in the rehabilitation of distressednation these too be requirement which must be meet by reason of ourvast power and the place we hold in the world some of the good thought of mankind have long be seek for a formulafor permanent peace undoubtedly the clarification of the principle ofinternational law would be helpful and the effort of scholar to preparesuch a work for adoption by the various nation should have our sympathyand support much may be hope for from the earnest study of those whoadvocate the outlawing of aggressive war but all these plan and preparation these treaty and covenant will not of themselves be adequate one ofthe great danger to peace lie in the economic pressure to which peoplefind themselves subject one of the most practical thing to be donein the world be to seek arrangement under which such pressure may be remove so that opportunity may be renew and hope may be revive there mustbe some assurance that effort and endeavor will be follow by successand prosperity in the making and financing of such adjustment there isnot only an opportunity but a real duty for america to respond with hercounsel and her resource condition must be provide under which peoplecan make a living and work out of their difficulty but there be anotherelement more important than all without which there can not be the slightesthope of a permanent peace that element lie in the heart of humanity unless the desire for peace be cherish there unless this fundamentaland only natural source of brotherly love be cultivate to its highestdegree all artificial effort will be in vain peace will come when thereis realization that only under a reign of law base on righteousness andsupporte by the religious conviction of the brotherhood of man can therebe any hope of a complete and satisfy life parchment will fail thesword will fail it be only the spiritual nature of man that can be triumphant it seem altogether probable that we can contribute most to these importantobject by maintain our position of political detachment and independence we be not identify with any old world interest this position shouldbe make more and more clear in our relation with all foreign country we be at peace with all of they our program be never to oppress butalway to assist but while we do justice to other we must require thatjustice be do to we with we a treaty of peace mean peace and a treatyof amity mean amity we have make great contribution to the settlementof contentious difference in both europe and asia but there be a verydefinite point beyond which we can not go we can only help those who helpthemselve mindful of these limitation the one great duty that standsout require we to use our enormous power to trim the balance of the world while we can look with a great deal of pleasure upon what we have doneabroad we must remember that our continued success in that direction dependsupon what we do at home since its very outset it have be find necessaryto conduct our government by mean of political party that system wouldnot have survive from generation to generation if it have not be fundamentallysound and provide the good instrumentality for the most complete expressionof the popular will it be not necessary to claim that it have always workedperfectly it be enough to know that nothing well have be devise noone would deny that there should be full and free expression and an opportunityfor independence of action within the party there be no salvation in anarrow and bigote partisanship but if there be to be responsible partygovernment the party label must be something more than a mere device forsecure office unless those who be elect under the same party designationare willing to assume sufficient responsibility and exhibit sufficientloyalty and coherence so that they can cooperate with each other in thesupport of the broad general principle of the party platform the electioni merely a mockery no decision be make at the poll and there be norepresentation of the popular will common honesty and good faith withthe people who support a party at the poll require that party when itenter office to assume the control of that portion of the governmentto which it have be elect any other course be bad faith and a violationof the party pledge when the country have bestow its confidence upon a party by makingit a majority in the congress it have a right to expect such unity of actiona will make the party majority an effective instrument of government this administration have come into power with a very clear and definitemandate from the people the expression of the popular will in favor ofmaintaine our constitutional guarantee be overwhelming and decisive there be a manifestation of such faith in the integrity of the courtsthat we can consider that issue reject for some time to come likewise the policy of public ownership of railroad and certain electric utilitiesmet with unmistakable defeat the people declare that they want theirright to have not a political but a judicial determination and theirindependence and freedom continue and support by have the ownershipand control of their property not in the government but in their ownhand as they always do when they have a fair chance the people demonstratedthat they be sound and be determined to have a sound government when we turn from what be reject to inquire what be accept thepolicy that stand out with the great clearness be that of economy inpublic expenditure with reduction and reform of taxation the principleinvolve in this effort be that of conservation the resource of thiscountry be almost beyond computation no mind can comprehend they butthe cost of our combine government be likewise almost beyond definition not only those who be now make their tax return but those who meetthe enhance cost of existence in their monthly bill know by hard experiencewhat this great burden be and what it do no matter what other may want these people want a drastic economy they be oppose to waste they knowthat extravagance lengthen the hour and diminish the reward of theirlabor i favor the policy of economy not because i wish to save money but because i wish to save people the man and woman of this country whotoil be the one who bear the cost of the government every dollar thatwe carelessly waste mean that their life will be so much the more meager every dollar that we prudently save mean that their life will be so muchthe more abundant economy be idealism in its most practical form if extravagance be not reflect in taxation and through taxationboth directly and indirectly injuriously affect the people it wouldnot be of so much consequence the wise and sound method of solvingour tax problem be through economy fortunately of all the great nationsthis country be good in a position to adopt that simple remedy we do notany long need wartime revenue the collection of any taxis which arenot absolutely require which do not beyond reasonable doubt contributeto the public welfare be only a species of legalized larceny under thisrepublic the reward of industry belong to those who earn they the onlyconstitutional tax be the tax which minister to public necessity theproperty of the country belong to the people of the country their titleis absolute they do not support any privileged class they do not needto maintain great military force they ought not to be burden with agreat array of public employee they be not require to make any contributionto government expenditure except that which they voluntarily assess uponthemselve through the action of their own representative whenever taxesbecome burdensome a remedy can be apply by the people but if they donot act for themselves no one can be very successful in act for they the time be arrive when we can have further tax reduction when unlesswe wish to hamper the people in their right to earn a living we must havetax reform the method of raise revenue ought not to impede the transactionof business it ought to encourage it i be oppose to extremely high rate because they produce little or no revenue because they be bad for thecountry and finally because they be wrong we can not finance the country we can not improve social condition through any system of injustice even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich those who suffer the mostharm will be the poor this country believe in prosperity it be absurdto suppose that it be envious of those who be already prosperous thewise and correct course to follow in taxation and all other economic legislationis not to destroy those who have already secure success but to createcondition under which every one will have a well chance to be successful the verdict of the country have be give on this question that verdictstand we shall do well to heed it these question involve moral issue we need not concern ourselvesmuch about the right of property if we will faithfully observe the rightsof person under our institution their right be supreme it be notproperty but the right to hold property both great and small which ourconstitution guarantee all owner of property be charge with a service these right and duty have be reveal through the conscience of society to have a divine sanction the very stability of our society rest uponproduction and conservation for individual or for government to wasteand squander their resource be to deny these right and disregard theseobligation the result of economic dissipation to a nation be always moraldecay these policy of well international understanding great economy and low taxis have contribute largely to peaceful and prosperous industrialrelation under the helpful influence of restrictive immigration anda protective tariff employment be plentiful the rate of pay be high and wage earner be in a state of contentment seldom before see ourtransportation system have be gradually recover and have be ableto meet all the requirement of the service agriculture have be veryslow in reviving but the price of cereal at last indicate that the dayof its deliverance be at hand we be not without our problem but our most important problem be notto secure new advantage but to maintain those which we already possess our system of government make up of three separate and independent department our divided sovereignty compose of nation and state the matchless wisdomthat be enshrine in our constitution all these need constant effort andtireless vigilance for their protection and support in a republic the first rule for the guidance of the citizen be obedienceto law under a despotism the law may be impose upon the subject he hasno voice in its making no influence in its administration it do notrepresent he under a free government the citizen make his own law choose his own administrator which do represent he those who wanttheir right respect under the constitution and the law ought to setthe example themselves of observe the constitution and the law whilethere may be those of high intelligence who violate the law

of civilization butare display the trait of ignorance of servitude of savagery andtreade the way that lead back to the jungle the essence of a republic be representative government our congressrepresent the people and the states in all legislative affair it isthe natural collaborator with the president in spite of all the criticismwhich often fall to its lot i do not hesitate to say that there be nomore independent and effective legislative body in the world it be andshould be jealous of its prerogative i welcome its cooperation and expectto share with it not only the responsibility but the credit for our commoneffort to secure beneficial legislation these be some of the principle which america represent we have notby any mean put they fully into practice but we have strongly signifiedour belief in they the encouraging feature of our country be not thatit have reach its destination but that it have overwhelmingly expressedit determination to proceed in the right direction it be true that wecould with profit be less sectional and more national in our thought it would be well if we could replace much that be only a false and ignorantprejudice with a true and enlightened pride of race but the last electionshowe that appeal to class and nationality have little effect we wereall find loyal to a common citizenship the fundamental precept of libertyis toleration we can not permit any inquisition either within or withoutthe law or apply any religious test to the holding of office the mindof america must be forever free it be in such contemplation my

after 150 anniversary repeatedly observe follow during the last three month by intensive celebration in this neighborhood where it have its beginning the american revolution should be fairly well understand if it need any justification if it need any praise it be enough to say that its product be america it ought to be unnecessary on this occasion to dwell very much on that event and its yet more remarkable result but no great movement in the progress of mankind have ever be accomplish without the guidance of an inspire leadership of this accept truth there be no more preeminent example than that which be reveal by the war which make this country independent wherever man love liberty wherever they believe in patriotism wherever they exalt high character by universal consent they turn to the name of george washington no occasion could be conceive more worthy more truly and comprehensively american than that which be choose to commemorate this divinely appoint captain the contemplation of his life and work will forever strengthen our faith in our country and in our country&#39; god
 those man who have take great part in the world be commonly rank by posterity accord to their accomplishment while live and the permanent worth of the monument represent their achievement which remain after they be go by this standard i think we may regard george washington as the first lay citizen of the world of all time he be one in whom the element of greatness be so evenly blend so accurately proportion that his character have well nigh defied analysis other have create wide commotion and deep impression in the hour of their eminence but we shall hardly find one who in his own day achieve so much as washington and leave his work so firmly establish that posterity generation after generation can only increase its tribute to his ability his wisdom his patriotism and his rounded perfection in the character of a christian citizen
 no figure in profane history have inspire so many testimony of admiration the high eloquence the most profound sincerity have be invoke to picture he as the very sum of public capacity and civic virtue no pride of race or country have even attempt to set up rival to he envy and malice have stand rebuke in the presence of his tower form there be no language of literature and culture which do not boast among its adornment noble eulogy of the work and character of washington although as history reckon its period it be but a little time since he pass from the stage of life he have be claim wherever man struggle and aspire as the possession of all humanity the first citizen of all the age
 so he must be a strangely bold and self confident eulogist who would attempt even on such an occasion as this to add anything to the total of affection admiration and reverence which have be rear as the true memorial of washington it be impossible for we to add to or take from the estimate which have be fix by the generation of the world
 but if the preeminent place of washington be thus establish beyond possibility of change at our hand it be only the more desirable that on this anniversary we should come here to do our reverence and to seek replenishment of the inspiration which be always to be draw from consideration of his life and work to the people of the republic whose existence be due to his leadership his life be the full and finished teaching of citizenship to other who may claim he only by virtue of the right of humanity to be heir to all the age his story be replete with example and admonition peculiarly applicable to the problem of the world and its people in these time
 we have come here because this day a century and a half ago and in this place washington formally assume command of the army of the colonies his foot trod this soil here be his headquarters here be his place of worship our first view therefore be of washington the soldier but he be indeed so much more than the soldier his talent be so many and so perfectly proportion that it be impossible to study he in any one of his capacity to the exclusion of the other in he we find also a marvelous instinct for statecraft support and sustain an equal genius for camp and field we see moreover the quality of a great man of business which be bring to serve the vast task of organize and equip his army we find he on one day write a noble and eloquent rebuke to a commander of the king&#39;s force who be bent on waive the law of civilized warfare and on another address compelling counsel of patriotism energy and executive sense to the continental congress and the provincial legislature in everything he be call to be the leader in everything his leadership work result which completely vindicate the confidence repose in he
 the complaint have be many time utter that washington be no nearly a paragon of ability and virtue that it be impossible to see through the aura of perfection to the real simple human man but there be a phase of washington&#39;s career which fully study and understand will give we the picture of he as one of the most human man in history to inform ourselves of this human side we need only to know of the long year of arduous preparation which precede the historic event which take place here 150 year ago to day
 from his early manhood washington&#39;s life have be a part of great affair many of those affair be vastly great and more significant than he himself or indeed anybody else could possibly have realize at the time he have come up through a schooling of strangely mingle adversity and success he have devote hard and disappointing year to activity which result aside from the training which he derive in little more than hopeless futility nobody can know the real washington the man washington without study closely his service to the virginia colony and the british crown during the year immediately precede and cover the old french war here we see he as a young man in whom the combination of rare and remarkable part be most easily discern we find he at time hot headed and impetuous always intensely impatient with incompetency in place of authority
 from the beginning we discover a special genius for command the respect and attention of old man when hardly more than a boy he be choose for a responsible and difficult mission to the french on the western frontier this mission bring he in contact with an important french officer who report to his government that this young man be likely to make more trouble for french interest in america than any 50 other people that observation be more profound than its maker could have realize washington have be send with a small force as the emissary of governor dinwiddie of virginia to notify the french that their aggression in the upper ohio territory be occasion of deep concern to the british colony and must cease it be the wish of washington and his superior that the message be deliver without bring about any clash at arm but event decreed otherwise and a skirmish take place in the wilderness in which a number of man be kill and wound among they a french officer of some rank and importance it be deeply suggestive of the destiny which have mark washington that this backwood brush at arm should have occasion the first bloodshed in that long series of war which be to drench the western world for near two generation and do not end until the downfall of napoleon
 from the day of that clash in the western forest of pennsylvania precipitate by the determination of washington to execute his mission the seven years&rsquo war be a foregone conclusion washington be denounce in france as a murderer a man eat freebooter of the wild in england his boldness and determination win he a good deal of reputation in the colony there be much difference of opinion for the time be whether his course be justify or have bring the country face to face with the possibility of a disastrous struggle
 at any rate from that day until the downfall of napoleon at waterloo there be no peace in either europe or america save for brief period which represent little more than temporary truce doubtless that long and fearful series of conflict be inevitable whether it be or not the fact of history show washington a youth of 22 as the commander whose order prove the torch to set a world on fire from that hour responsible man in both britain and france realize that there could be no last peace until those country have fight the duel which should determine the supremacy of one or the other in the new world there be not room for both
 so come the seven years&rsquo war and the establishment of british domination in north america a little later come the american revolution the french revolution and the napoleonic war one can but wonder what might have be the reflection of washington if he could have imagine on that july morning of 1754 when he resolve that he must fight if he could have know the train of event that would follow upon his determination but such conjecture be of little value to we there be more of immediate interest in the curious coincidence that the skirmish for possession of fort necessity take place on july 3 1754 exactly 21 year before the day when washington in this place assume command of the continental army
 and those 21 year as washington live they constitute a fitting probation for the career that await he the echo of the little battle of fort necessity reverberate throughout the american colonies and the european court as if it have be an engagement of titans its political effect be tremendous it make washington a marked man throughout the colonies and give he a real european reputation
 his part in the braddock expedition though vastly well know probably have less effect in form his character or direct his career than his expedition to fort necessity nevertheless his reputation be far increase by his conduct in the braddock campaign but that heroic episode be follow by a long and disappointing experience as head of the virginia forces defend the western frontier he see little of satisfy service during this period but he learn the supreme importance of organization and preparation in connection with military operation in the end it be his privilege to lead his virginians to the occupation of fort pitt when it be finally surrender by the french but the real campaign for control of the ohio valley be make from the north by general wolfe on the plains of abraham rather than from virginia and washington find his part in it disappointingly small
 not only the braddock campaign of 1755 but his early operation both diplomatic and military on the upper ohio mark he as a man of caution sagacity and wisdom in plan and conduct military operation at the same time they show he as the intrepid and fearless fighting soldier in the hour of action
 one thing that washington learn during the french war must have contribute greatly to form his opinion about relation between britain and the colonies he be bring to realize that the form of colonial government with which bitter experience make he so familiar could not long satisfy the people of the large wealthy and fast grow colony with washington the idea of substantial freedom long precede that of independence like most of the colonial youth he hope that a more enlightened policy in london and a more sympathetic execution of it by the royal governor might compose the grow difference during the troublous epoch between the french war and the revolution he think deeply of these matter and his correspondence give evidence of the grow impression that a contest must come he follow the development of event in massachusetts with a close and understand concern his writing and occasional public pronouncement during this period show he acutely anxious that the colonies should present a united front when the test come one in his position of leadership authority and independent fortune live as a virginia gentleman might easily enough have feel that the trouble of the massachusetts bay colony have small concern for he high churchman conformist in most thing enjoy excellent repute in england and with english official in america his influence might logically enough have be throw to the royalist yet as early as the spring of 1769 he write declare our lordly master in great britain will be satisfied with nothing less than the deprivation of american freedom and inquire what could be do to avert such a calamity he add that no man should scruple or hesitate a moment to use arm in defense of so valuable a blessing be clearly my opinion yet arm i would beg to add should be the last resource a little later in that same year washington at a public meeting offer a nonimportation resolution and secure its adoption
 in short it be plain that he be anxious to keep the sentiment of the southern colonies fully in step and sympathy with the attitude of the new england patriot who at the moment be bear the brunt of the struggle or colonial right seemingly the boston port bill convince he that the colonies must prepare for the harsh eventuality at a meeting of the citizen of his county he helped draft a petition and remonstrance to the king which conclude with the ominous word from our sovereign there can be but the appeal such a declaration come from one whose repute be high in all the colonies and who be begin to speak with the voice of something like authority for the southern community could not fail to strengthen the arm and purpose of the new englanders
 the selection of washington to command the continental armies have i think be too much attribute to his high military repute and too little to the fact that he have long take the view of a true statesman regard the impending crisis the fact be that he have all along see the struggle as a continental and national one he realize that massachusetts could not win alone nor could new england in help to set up the committee of correspondence in mold the sentiment of virginia in his service as member of the continental congress the ideal of a firm and whole hearted union of all the colonies be plainly fundamental repeatedly in his writing even long before the struggle have seriously suggest the possibility of war he use the phrase our country give it an application vastly broad than the domain or concern of any single colony he be among the first to see the vision of an american nation no other man so early grasp certain physical and geographic argument which urge nationality as inevitable
 in this his engineering training together with his intimate knowledge of the topography of the ohio and potomac valleys have an important part as a young surveyor he realize the importance of that break through the allegheny system which these two valley mark many year later he point out its strategic importance in connection with the defense and unity of the colonies front the atlantic before the ohio be much more than a myth to most people even in virginia washington see that the ohio basin must be control by the colonies if they be to be secure
 thus it be that a complete and clear vision of all the argument for national unity be due to the many sidedness of the washington mind he see it as politician as statesman as military man as engineer without such a grasp of all the element he could not have take the statesmanly and essentially national view of the problem before hostility begin nor could he have deal effectively with its military aspect during the war he possess one of those rarely endow mind which not only recognize all the factor but assign to each its proper weight
 he be in truth a consummate politician when he go to the sitting of the continental congress wear his virginia uniform of buff and blue some be inclined to ridicule the display of military predilection they accuse he of swashbuckling and point to his uniform as equivalent to announcement of his candidacy for commander in chief in the first they be utterly wrong in the second quite probably right that uniform when he preside over the committee on military preparation could hardly have be construe as mean anything other than that its wearer realize what be ahead and be willing to force some part of that realization on other
 i suppose if we be to pick any two man out of that gathering to be set down as something other than politician washington and sturdy old john adams would be well toward the top in the polling though they approach the matter from utterly different angle they be both lead by the sagacity of great politician to the same conclusion to both the crisis be essentially national a nation must be create to deal with it the army before boston must be take over by the congress as a national army there must be a commander in chief supreme in the military field all this we look back upon as illumine statesmanship but statesmanship be nothing more than good sound politic test and prove that be what it be when john adams conceive the great strategy of call a man of the south to the chief command a more provincial man might have dream of massachusetts aid by the other colony take and hold the lead and garner the lion&#39; share of glory but adams be plan in term of a nation not of province and washington have for year be write of our country so washington put on his uniform in testimony of his readiness for whatever might happen and adams after some period of misgiving set about convince the delegate from new england and the middle colonies that there must be a nation and a national army with a commander in chief and that must be washington
 it be a stroke of political genius that adams soul of puritanic idealism should have move the adoption of the army by congress and the selection of washington as commander in chief the selection be make without a dissent vote though it be not true to say that washington be unanimously prefer already there be clash ambition and divergent community interest but adams see and make other see the peculiar reason that urge washington the middle colonies dominate by their land aristocracy have much in common with the social and economic system of the south to they washington mean the enlistment of property substance and eminent respectability in present his name to the congress adams describe he in term which seem prophetic and which we can hardly improve a gentleman whose skill and experience as an officer whose independent fortune great talent and excellent universal character would command the approbation of all america and unite the cordial exertion of all the colony well than any other person in the union
 let it ever be set down to the glory of massachusetts that john adams make george washington commander in chief of the continental armies and john marshall chief justice of the united states destiny could have do no more
 immediately after his selection washington set out from philadelphia for boston on the way he receive first tiding of the battle of bunker hill which have be fight two day after he be name for commander he inquire eagerly about the behavior of the continental troop and when he learn now splendidly they have fight against the british regular he quietly declare that the liberty of the country be safe in that anxious hour the battle of 20 year early in the pennsylvania wood wherein his virginia militia have save braddock&#39;s regular from destruction no doubt be near the top of his mind to be assure that the raw levy of new england be capable of behave just as well in 1775 as his virginians have do in 1755 must have be intensely reassuring
 know the story of the revolution as we do we can not doubt that the historic event which take place here 150 year ago to day mark one of its crisis even with washington the struggle be well nigh lose at several period of course the ultimate separation of the colonies from the mother country be inevitable he have the revolution of 1775 fail as it must have fail without washington there would have be harsh and vindictive reprisal nobody can read the arrogant pronouncement of lord north&#39;s government or the still more arrogant letter of general gage to washington and avoid conviction that the british government and its american military representative would have vie with each other in effort to estrange the colonies such a policy would have establish tradition of animosity that would have keep the struggle alive even after a nominal peace in the end separation would have come but it might have be delay through many recurrence of turbulence and struggle it be vastly to the good of both the mother country and the colonies that the conflict be once begin it be bring to a decisive conclusion
 there be another reason why the final victory of the colonies be important to the world it be just as necessary for the maintenance of the british empire as for the proper development of the american community i believe this view be now generally accept by british student as well as americans we may be sure that it be in the mind of the great chatham who have lay the foundation of the british empire in the seven years&rsquo war if there be a man in all that realm who might well have be give attention when the american crisis be develop that man be chatham he have find britain weak and have build it into strength he have well nigh make the whole north american continent british he have reestablish the empire and extend it in many direction yet chatham know that lord north&#39;s policy would surely cost the loss of the american dominion emerge from a long political retirement defy the doctor he hate and the king he have serve the grand old man hurry down to the house of lords to pronounce his allegiance to the cause of the colonies when your lordship say he look at the paper transmit to we from america when you consider their decency their firmness their wisdom you can not but respect their cause and wish to make it your own that decency firmness and wisdom be in no small part george washington
 chatham know what it have be to build an empire he would not see it throw away without have his protest heard he speak the voice of liberalism in england but the king and his minister have no ear for such counsel they have fix their course and could not be swerve
 washington&#39;s assumption of the command give the colonial cause an effective national character have he not possess the genius and the power to impress other with that conception it be hardly conceivable that disaster could long have be postpone he find himself in command of an unorganized undisciplined unprovisioned and unmunitoned body of some 14,000 militia oppose an army of 11,000 regular shut up in boston and support by a naval power that completely command the sea washington be call first to make an army then to drive his enemy out of boston and then to meet attack at whatever point along the coast the enemy might choose where many other quite as sincere in their patriotism fondly imagine that the evacuation of boston would move the london government to make peace he be convince that it would be little more than the beginning for the long struggle he foresaw he have to prepare not only by create an army but by convince the civil authority and the people that he must have the utmost measure of their support and cooperation so we find he immediately upon assume his command divide his time between military task and the writing of endless letter to the leader of the congress to the provincial assembly to man of importance everywhere design to impress they with the enormity of the come struggle
 this be not the time or place for a review of washington&#39;s military career yet there be phase of that career which i be never able to pass over without a word of wonder and admiration because of some of the exploit which it include
 it be record that a few evening after the surrender of lord cornwallis at yorktown a banquet be give by washington and his staff to the british commander and his staff one like to contemplate the sportsmanship of that function amiability and good wish be duly exchange and finally lord cornwallis rise to present his compliment to washington there have be much talk of past campaigning experience and cornwallis turn to washington express the judgment that when history&#39; verdict be make up the bright garland for your excellency will be gather not from the shore of the chesapeake but from the bank of the delaware we may fairly assume that cornwallis in the fullness of a very personal experience be qualified to judge washington have outgeneral and defeat he both on the bank of the delaware and the shore of the chesapeake in give the laurel to the trenton princeton campaign he express not only his own judgment but the estimate which be afterwards pronounce by frederick the great who declare that the trenton princeton campaign be the most brilliant military performance of the century for myself without pretense of military wisdom the lightninglike stroke of trenton and princeton in its supreme audacity and ideal execution have always seem the most perfectly timed combination of military genius and political wisdom that we find in the record of warfare
 on the other hand much can be urge to support the claim that yorktown be the most brilliant campaign of washington with an army on the point of disintegration he be almost utterly unable to get supply and transport yet he manage to withdraw his force from before new york and get they well on the way to virginia before his enemy seriously suspect his design it be a miracle of military skill diplomacy and determination to effect on the virginia peninsula that consolidation of force from south and north along with the french army and fleet at precisely the right moment the essence of strategy be to divide the force of the enemy and defeat they in detail and there be few campaign which show a commander accomplish this through operation cover so extend a territory and involve so many difficulty
 in the yorktown campaign we sell all the varied element of washington&#39;s genius at work he have to deal at once with an inert congress that be threaten at this critical moment actually to reduce the army he have to find supply and money or get along without they in part he do one in part the other he have to effect a junction of widely separate force and to maintain secrecy to the last moment everything must be alone within a period of time so short that it might well have make success appear utterly impossible because he could not count on the cooperation of the french for a long period all these thing he accomplish accomplish they he win the war as in the campaign of trenton and princeton he have save the revolution no man could have render his service to the revolution who be not both a soldier and statesman he understand and he never underestimate the political bearing of every move
 when he retire to mount vernon washington enter upon a new phase of his career he have win the war but he be a man of peace his experience as commander in chief have completely convince he that the form of government under the confederation could not possibly serve the necessity of the country it be not possible here to outline the discouragement which threaten the country with all manner disaster washington as the most influential citizen be the inevitable leader in prepare for the constitutional convention of 1787 and the establishment of a real nation that task he take up early and to it he devote an energy and a wisdom that be alike amazing it be quite natural that he should be choose to preside over the constitutional convention when its work be do his influence be one of the chief force to bring about ratification after that there be none to question that he must be the first president under the new r&eacute;gime
 perhaps no character in history have be subject to more close study or sympathetic analysis than that of washington the volume of his writing which have be leave to we be enormous moreover from early manhood his life be live almost continuously under intense public observation it be therefore remarkable that biographer and eulogist should be so generally accuse of fail to give we a satisfying picture of he the fault however be not his but theirs the explanation be that no biographer have possess and probably none ever will possess the full rounded measure of qualification to appreciate to understand to apportion and to weigh all the element that make this man unfortunately a vast myth be early build around washington difficult to avoid and not even yet entirely dissipate among his biographer and eulogist some have see first and most admiringly the great soldier some have be most engaged with he as the statesman politician deal with great affair from day to day as circumstance demand other have devote themselves particularly to portray he as the constructive student of government and builder of institution still other have find their first inspiration in his work as a wise firm and discriminate administrator
 volume have be write and they be exceedingly interesting volume on washington as a pioneer of modern scientific agriculture it be interesting to recall that in their taste for agriculture washington and his great antagonist king george iii stand on a common ground whoever care to familiarize himself with this particular detail on the career of washington and the king will find that these two might in other circumstance have be the good of friend for both be devoted admirer and supporter of arthur young the famous english traveler and agricultural authority in the last year or two before the beginning of the french revolution young travel extensively throughout france he keep a journal of his observation and experience that have since be invaluable to whoever wish to know condition in the france of that time besides all this arthur young be almost the founder of the modern science and technique of advanced agriculture he write and publish voluminously on such subject as rotation of crop scientific fertilization farm drainage the breeding of livestock the grow of plant and many other subject which be now commonplace king george become interested in his work and turn over to he some farm of the royal domain to be conduct as the early agricultural experiment station
 young publish an agricultural journal devote to his theory and experiment and to it washington become a subscriber this lead he into a correspondence with young which seem to have be quite extended convince that the young program represent much of value to american agriculture washington offer to set aside one of his farm to be manage by english expert if young would enlist they apparently nothing finally come of this proposal but the act that it be make and seriously consider show how near washington and king george come to an intimate association for the betterment of agriculture indeed inside of two year after the end of the revolution washington appeal to young to buy and ship to he an invoice of agricultural implement and seed with which washington desire to experiment on investigation young discover that british law forbid these export so he go to the minister for home affairs lord grenville and plead for permission to send they it be immediately grant and by the courtesy of the british government the entire order be fill the incident be an interesting indication of the liberal disposition manifest so soon after the war by lead man of both country
 it be a pleasant thing to be privileged to recall on an occasion like this such a bit of evidence touch the underlie community of interest between the old kingdom and the new republic in matter of common concern and human advancement washington be the last person to harbor resentment and in his and other instance he more than once find his former enemy ready to meet he half way as we look back now on a century and more of uninterrupted peace between the two nation we can not but feel that such peace and the long period of international cooperation which it have make possible have be in no small part a testimony to the generous willingness of all man everywhere to recognize as the first citizen of the world he who have be so long acclaim as the first american
 it have be my expectation to confine my address to general washington and leave the stately and solemn grandeur of this great figure as the sole subject for the thought of those who might hear i i shall not enter into the vain speculation of what he might do if he be live to day yet his farewell address show conclusively that he hope to be able to lay down certain principle of conduct for his fellow countryman which would be of advantage to they so long as the nation into which he have work his life might endure no doubt he know the whole world would hear he he have see the life of the soldier in time of war and after that of the statesman in time of peace he have an abide faith in honesty he believe mightily in his fellow man the vigor with which he insist on the prosecution of war be no less than the vigor with which he insist on the observance of peace he cherish no resentment he harbor no hatred he forgive his enemy he feel the same obligation to execute the term of a treaty make for the benefit of a former foe that he feel to require the observance of those make for the benefit of his own country he realize that peace could be the result only of mutual forbearance and mutual good faith
 he harmonize the divergent and conflicting interest of different nationality and different colonial government by conference and agreement he demonstrate by his argument and our country have demonstrate by experience that more progress can be make by cooperation than by conflict to agree quickly with your adversary always pay
 the world have not outgrow it can never outgrow the absolute necessity for conformity to these eternal principle i want to see america assume a leadership among the nation in the reliance upon the good faith of mankind i do not see how civilization can expect permanent progress on any other theory if what be save in the productive peace of to day be to be lose in the destructive war of to morrow the people of this earth can look forward to nothing but everlaste servitude there be no justification for hope this be not the conception which washington have of life
 if the people of the old world be mutually distrustful of each other let they enter into mutual covenant for their mutual security and when such covenant have be make let they be solemnly observe no matter what he sacrifice they have settle the far more difficult problem of reparation they be in process of fund their debt to we why can they not agree on permanent term of peace and fully reestablish international faith and credit if there be difference which can not be adjust at the moment if there be condition which can not be foresee let they be resolve in the future by method of arbitration and by the form of judicial determination
 while our own country should refrain from make political commitment where it do not have political interest such covenant would always have the moral support of our government and could not fail to have the commendation of the public opinion of the world such a course would be sure to endow the participate nation with an abundant material and spiritual reward on what other basis can there be any encouragement for a disposition to attempt to finance a revival of europe the world have try war with force and have utterly fail the only hope of success lie in peace with justice no other principle conform to the teaching of washington no other standard be worthy of the spirit of america no other course make so much promise for the regeneration of the world

mr. moderator members of the council
 it be my understanding that the purpose of this council be to enlarge and improve the moral and spiritual life of the nation while i appreciate that its purpose be religious rather than political i have feel a propriety in come here because of my belief in the necessity for a grow reliance of the political success of our government upon the religious conviction of our people
 everyone recognize that our modern life have become more and more complex it have become more and more interdependent this be true in our economic life it be true in our political life with the extension of knowledge and science with the new power that these have confer there be a multitude of way and opportunity for commit crime for do wrong which result in personal and property injury to other and for pervert that which ought to minister to our well being to the service of evil end which in former day do not exist new occasion have be open for the turning of the instrumentality of government which ought to be use for the public welfare into the service of selfish and misguided interest temptation have be both multiply and intensify the peril both to the individual and to society have in numerous way be increase manyfold
 it be notorious that crime and violence always follow in the wake of war it appear to be the rule that there be a dissolution of the old restraint bring about by the reaction which follow from the severe discipline and nervous tension of an era of conflict these may be and probably be a temporary state which will tend to disappear with the mere passage of time but too many of our people have find oftentime to their sorrow that the privilege of liberty instead of be easy to enjoy be in reality highly difficult responsibility require the utmost of effort for success nor can it be deny that on the part of some there be a tendency to disregard too many of the former standard of society and too much of the former influence of authority
 another characteristic of our present state of civilization which have already be note and comment upon be the disposition of those who be less well equipped to receive the benefit of the modern state of society through bear its burden to attempt to resist all effort to subject they to the necessary restraint and discipline and to try to tear down and destroy the result which other have secure by generation of constant effort what other have accumulate through industry and self denial they propose to seize and to dissipate and destroy through indolence and self indulgence without compensation to its rightful owner lawlessness be altogether too prevalent and a lack of respect for government and the convention of enlightened society be altogether too apparent
 it be because i do not know of any political method of adequately deal with these difficulty that i have venture to bring they to the attention of this council
 it be natural to attempt to shift the blame from ourselves to other when evil condition arise it be always easy to criticize the government for failure to reform all moral to prevent all crime and generally to abolish all evil i have great faith in the local and national government of the united states but much of this field be beyond their reach they be not establish to discharge this duty they be utterly unable to accomplish it the chief function of organize government be to maintain order provide security for person and property and set up the instrumentality for the administration of justice this mean the making interpretation and the execution of the law through the legislature the judiciary the executive and all the various machinery of administration which these imply but it ought always to be remember that our institution have undertake to recognize that the human mind be and must be free this be one of the reason why it be neither practical nor justifiable to impose upon the government the responsibility for the ultimate provision of the instrumentality which minister to the spiritual life
 it be true that the government can aid and be aid in the solution of some of the problem to which i have already refer without doubt the law act as a deterrent to wrong doing and will usually go a long way in the repression of crime but this reach its high application only when there be a very healthy and determined public sentiment in favor of the observance of the law the utmost ingenuity on the part of the police power will be substantially all waste in an effort to enforce the law if there do not exist a strong and vigorous determination on the part of the people to observe the law such a determination can not be produce by the government my own opinion be that it be furnish by religion
 another contribution of great benefit which be carry on so successfully by the local public authority be that of education it be well know that ignorance and vice and crime all flourish together our local school which be sanction by the states and cherish by the national government be institution of enormous value not only in provide earn for our youth but in remove the prejudice which naturally would exist among various racial group and bring the rise generation of our people to a common understanding a more thorough comprehension of our political and social institution have rarely fail to produce a more loyal citizen with few exception those who come to we as enemy of society be so because they have always find society enemy to they education in the element and fundamental of the american principle of human relationship have seldom fail to secure their allegiance but the mere sharpening of the wit the bare training of the intellect the naked acquisition of science while they would greatly increase the power for good likewise increase the power for evil an intellectual growth will only add to our confusion unless it be accompany by a moral growth i do not know of any source of more power other than that which come from religion
 but there be another and more basic reason why the government can not supply the source and motive for the complete reformation of society in the progress of the human race religious belief be develop before the formation of government it be my understanding that government rest on religion while in our own country we have wisely separate the church and the state in order to emancipate faith from all political interference nevertheless the form and theory of our government be lay in accordance with the prevail religious conviction of the people the great revival of the middle of the eighteenth century have a marked influence upon our revolutionary period the claim to the right to freedom the claim to the right to equality with the resultant right to self government the rule of the people have no foundation other than the common brotherhood of man derive from the common fatherhood of god the righteous authority of the law depend for its sanction upon its harmony with the righteous authority of the almighty if this faith be set aside the foundation of our institution fail the citizen be depose from the high estate which he hold as amenable to a universal conscience society revert to a system of class and caste and the government instead of be impose by reason from within be impose by force from without freedom and democracy would give way to despotism and slavery i do not know of any adequate support for our form of government except that which come from religion
 our history have be mark by the contribution which have be make by clergyman to the cause of education and government i need only to remind you that the rev. thomas shepherd be the lead influence in the establishment of the first college in the united states charter in massachusetts in 1636 two year later at hartford the rev. thomas hooker be declare the fundamental principle upon which the american republic be to rest which be supplement early in the next century at ipswich by the writing and sermon of the rev. john wise it be my understanding that these eminent divine be preach good congregational doctrine though of course many other denomination have just as vigorously support the same principle these contribution be not make in any narrow or lay sense but result from the broad general teaching of the necessity for an enlightened and consecrated people and from the conclusion draw from their theology as to the relation of man to each other and to their god the teaching of religion necessarily teach education and government
 it be on this theory that our institution of government rest we do not look upon the authority of the state as something impose by a select few upon the masse of the people through the special dispensation of divine right or by the force of military power but we rather recognize the universal divine right include all the people to govern themselves in accordance with the dictate of a common conscience if the people be the government it can not rise above they it can not furnish they with something they do not have it will be what they be this be true representation the government will be able to get out of the people only such virtue as religion have place there if society resist wrongdoing by punishment as it must do unless it be willing to approve it through failure to resist it for there be no middle ground it may protect itself as it be justify in do by restrain a criminal but that in and of itself do not reform he it be only a treatment of a symptom it do not eradicate the disease it do not make the community virtuous no amount of restraint no amount of law can do that if our political and social standard be the result of an enlightened conscience then their perfection depend upon secure a more enlightened conscience thomas shepherd be not a great moral leader because he believe in promote education he believe in promote education because he be a great moral leader thomas hooker and john wise be not great spiritual light because they declare the principle of sound government they declare the principle of sound government because they be great spiritual light it be necessary to do something more than to have government treat symptom if we be to preserve what we already have and provide for further reformation we must become a nation of partaker of the spirit of shepherd and hooker and wise or as the clergy tell we we must become partaker of the spirit of the great master this way be outside of the government it be the realm of religion
 it be this absolute necessity for support of the government outside itself through religion that i wish to impress upon this assembly without that support political effort would be practically fruitless it be not in any denominational or any narrow and technical sense that i refer to religion i mean to include all that can be bring within that broad general definition while i regard the clergy as the great power for religious teaching that we have i do not refer to they alone i be conscious that the example of devoted man and woman the result of the inevitable social relation and above all the influence of piety in the home be all force of enormous significance while certain formality of the past may have lose the hold they once have i do not see any diminution in the steadfastness of the religious conviction of the people if these be break down society might go on for a time under its own momentum but it would be have for destruction we do not possess any other enlightening force we do not have any other hope for the reform and perfection of society there be no other method by which we can have life and have it more abundantly
 while i have point out some of the difficulty and peril with which we be threaten at the present time and while i believe we may well heed they and be warn by they it be by no mean my desire to sound any note of discouragement the very fact that amid all the complexity and distraction of our present life we be still maintain unimpaire the foundation of our institution constantly increase the rectitude with which the great business affair of our country be conduct all the while improve our educational facility answer more and more generously to the call of public and private charity continually enlarge the field of art give more and more attention to the humanity and become more and more responsive to spiritual thing appear to more to be incontrovertible evidence that though it may be practice in a somewhat different manner than formerly the deep and abide faith of our people in religion have not diminish but have increase
 i have try to indicate what i think the country need in the way of help under present condition it need more religion if there be any general failure in the enforcement of the law it be because there have first be general failure in the disposition to observe the law i can conceive of no adequate remedy for the evil which beset society except through the influence of religion there be no form of education which will not fail there be no form of government which will not fail there be no form of reward which will not fail redemption must come through sacrifice and sacrifice be the essence of religion it will be of untold benefit if there be a broad comprehension of this principle by the public and a continued preaching of this crusade by the clergy it be only through these avenue by a constant renewal and extension of our faith that we can expect to enlarge and improve the moral and spiritual life of the nation without that faith all that we have of an enlightened civilization can not endure

member of the congress in meet the constitutional requirement of inform the congress upon the state of the union it be exceedingly gratifying to report that the general condition be one of progress and prosperity here and there be comparatively small and apparently temporary difficulty need adjustment and improve administrative method such as be always to be expect but i ii the fundamental of government and business the result demonstrate that we be go in the right direction the country do not appear to require radical departure from the policy already adopt so much as it need a further extension of these policy and the improvement of detail the age of perfection be still in the somewhat distant future but it be more in danger of be retard by mistaken government activity than it be from lack of legislation we be by far the most likely to accomplish permanent good if we proceed with moderation in our country the people be sovereign and independent and must accept the result responsibility it be their duty to support themselves and support the government that be the business of the nation whatever the charity of the nation may require the function which the congress be to discharge be not those of local government but of national government the great solicitude should be exercise to prevent any encroachment upon the right of the states or their various political subdivision local self government be one of our most precious possession it be the great contributing factor to the stability strength liberty and progress of the nation it ought not to be in ring by assault or undermine by purchase it ought not to abdicate its power through weakness or resign its authority through favor it do not at all follow that because abuse exist it be the concern of the federal government to attempt the r reform society be in much more danger from encumber the national government beyond its wisdom to comprehend or its ability to administer than from leave the local community to bear their own burden and remedy their own evil our local habit and custom be so strong our variety of race and creed be so great the federal authority be so tenuous that the area within which it can function successfully be very limited the wise policy be to leave the locality so far as we can possess of their own source of revenue and charge with their own obligation government economy it be a fundamental principle of our country that the people be sovereign while they recognize the undeniable authority of the state they have establish as its instrument a government of limited power they hold inviolate in their own hand the jurisdiction over their own freedom and the ownership of their own property neither of these can be impair except by due process of law the wealth of our country be not public wealth but private wealth it do not belong to the government it belong to the people the government have no justification in take private property except for a public purpose it be always necessary to keep these principle in mind in the laying of taxis and in the making of appropriation no right exist to levy on a dollar or to order the expenditure of a dollar of the money of the people except for a necessary public purpose duly authorize by the constitution the power over the purse be the power over liberty that be the legal limitation within which the congress can act how it will proceed within this limitation be always a question of policy when the country be prosperous and free from debt when the rate of taxation be low opportunity exist for assume new burden and undertake new enterprise such a condition now prevail only to a limited extent all proposal for assume new obligation ought to be postpone unless they be reproductive capital investment or be such as be absolutely necessary at this time we still have an enormous debt of over $ 20,000,000,000 on which the interest and sinking fund requirement be $ 1,320,000,000 our appropriation for the pension office and the veterans bureau be $ 600,000,000 the war and navy departments call for $ 642,000,000 other requirement exclusive of the post office which be virtually self sustain bring the appropriation for the current year up to almost c3,100,060,000 this show an expenditure of close to $ 30 for every inhabitant of our country for the average family of five it mean a tax directly or indirectly pay of about $ 150 for national purpose alone the local tax add much more these enormous expenditure ought not to be increase but through every possible effort they ought to be reduce only one of these great item can be ultimately extinguish that be the item of our war debt already this have be reduce to about $ 6,000,000,000 which mean an annual saving in interest of close to $ 250,000,000 the present interest charge be about $ 820,000,000 yearly it would seem to be obvious that the soon this debt can be retire the more the taxpayer will save in interest and the easy it will be to secure fund with which to prosecute need running expense construction and improvement this item of $ 820,000,000 for interest be a heavy charge on all the people of the country and it seem to i that we might well consider whether it be not greatly worth while to dispense with it as early as possible by retire the principal debt which it be require to serve it have always be our policy to retire our debt that of the revolutionary war period notwithstanding the addition make in 1812 be pay by 1835 and the civil war debt within 23 year of the amount already pay over $ 1,000,000,000 be a reduction in cash balance that source be exhaust over one and two third billion of dollar be derive from excess receipt tax reduction eliminate that the sale of surplus war material have be another element of our income that be practically finish with these eliminate the reduction of the debt have be only about $ 500,000,000 each year not an excessive sum on so large a debt proposal have be make to extend the payment over a period of 62 year if $ 1,000,000,000 be pay at the end of 20 year the cost to the taxpayer be the principal and i f the interest be 4 per cent a total of $ 1,850,000,000 if the same sum be pay at the end of 62 year the cost be $ 3,635,000,000 or almost double here be another consideration compare with its purchasing power in 1913 the dollar we borrow represent but 52 cent as the value of our dollar increase due to the fall price of commodity the burden of our debt increase it have now rise to 631/2 cent the taxpayer will be require to produce nearly twice the amount of commodity to pay his debt if the dollar return to the 1913 value the more we pay while price be high the easy it will be deflation of government after a war period be slow than deflation of business where curtailment be either prompt and effective or disaster follow there be room for further economy in the cost of the federal government but a co n of current expenditure with pre war expenditure be not able to the efficiency with which government business be now be do the expenditure of 19161 the last pre war year be $ 742,000,000 and in 1925 over $ 3,500,000,000 or nearly five time as great if we subtract expenditure for debt retirement and interest veteran relief increase of pension and other special outlay consist of refund trust investment and like charge we find that the general expenditure of the government in 1925 be slightly more than twice as large as in 1916.as price in 1925 be approximately 40 per cent high than in 1916 the cost of the same government must also have increase but the government be not the same it be more expensive to collect the much great revenue necessary and to administer our great debt we have give enlarge and improve service to agriculture and commerce above all america have grow in population and wealth government expenditure must always share inthis growth take into account the factor i have mention i believe that present federal expense be not far out of line with pre war expense we have nearly accomplish the deflation this do not mean that further economy will not come as we reduce our debt our interest charge decline there be many detail yet to correct the real improvement however must come not from additional curtailment of expense but by a more intelligent more order spending our economy must be constructive while we should avoid as far as possible increase in permanent current expenditure oftentime a capital outlay like internal improvement will result in actual constructive saving that be economy in its good sense it be an avoidance of waste that there may be the mean for an outlay to day which will bring large return to morrow we should constantly engage in scientific study of our future requirement and adopt an orderly program for their service economy be the method by which we prepare to day to afford the improvement of to morrow a mere policy of economy without any instrumentality for put it into operation would be very ineffective the congress have wisely set up the bureau of the budget to investigate and inform the president what recommendation he ought to make for current appropriation this give a centralized authority where a general and comprehensive understanding can be reach of the source of income and the most equitable distribution of expenditure how well it have work be indicate by the fact that the departmental estimate for 1922 before the budget law be $ 4,068,000,000 while the budget estimate for 1927 be $ 3,156,000,000 this latter figure show the reduction in departmental estimate for the come year make possible by the operation of the budget system that the congress have provide but it be evidently not enough to have care in make appropriation without any restraint upon expenditure the congress have provide that check by establish the office of comptroller general the purpose of maintain the budget director and the comptroller general be to secure economy and efficiency in government expenditure no well method have be devise for the accomplishment of that end these office can not be administer in all the various detail without make some error both of fact and of judgment but the important consideration remain that these be the instrumentality of the congress and that no other plan have ever be adopt which be so successful in promote economy and efficiency the congress have absolute authority over the appropriation and be free to exercise its judgment as the evidence may warrant in increase or decrease budget recommendation but it ought to resist every effort to weaken or break down this most beneficial system of supervise appropriation and expenditure without it all the claim of economy would be a mere pretense taxation the purpose of reduce expenditure be to secure a reduction in taxis that purpose be about to be realize with commendable promptness the ways and means committee of the house have undertake in advance of the meeting of the congress to frame a revenue act as the bill have proceed through the committee it have take on a nonpartisan character and both republicans and democrats have join in a measure which embody many sound principle of tax reform the bill will correct substantially the economic defect inject into the revenue act of 1924 as well as many which have remain as war time legacy in its present form it should provide sufficient revenue for the government the excessive surtax have be reduce estate tax rate arv restore to more reasonable figure with every prospect of withdraw from the field when the states have have the opportunity to correct the abuse in their own inheritance tax law the gift tax and publicity section be to be repeal many miscellaneous taxis be lower or abandon and the board of tax appeals and the administrative feature of the law be improve and strengthen i approve of the bill in principle in so far as income tax exemption be concern it seem to i the committee have go as far as it be safe to go and somewhat far than i should have go any further extension along these line would in my opinion impair tile integrity of our income tax system i be advise that the bill will be through the house by christmas for this prompt action the country call thank the good sense of the ways and means committee in frame an economic measure upon economic consideration if this attitude continue to be reflect through the congress the taxpayer will have his relief by the time his march 15th installment of income

constituent i commend the example of file ways and means committee if follow it will place sound legislation upon the book in time to give the taxpayer the full benefit of tax reduction next year this mean that the bill should reach i prior to march 15.all these economic result be be seek not to benefit the rich but to benefit the people they be for the purpose of encourage industry in order that employment may be plentiful they seek to make business good in order that wage may be good they encourage prosperity in order that poverty may be banish from the home they seek to lay the foundation which through increase production may give the people a more bountiful supply of the necessary of life afford more leisure for the improvement of the mind the appreciation of the art of music and literature sculpture and painting and the beneficial enjoyment of outdoor sport and recreation enlarge the resource which minister to charity and by au these mean attempt to strengthen the spiritual life of the nation foreign relation the policy of our foreign relation cast aside any suggestion of force rest solely on the foundation of peace good will and good work we have seek in our intercourse with other nation well understanding through conference and exchange of view its befits being endow with reason the result have be the gradual elimination of dispute the settlement of controversy and the establishment of a firm friendship between america and the rest of the world that have ever exist tit any previous time the example of this attitude have not be without its influence upon other country act upon it an adjustment be make of the difficult problem of reparation this be the second step toward peace in europe it pave the way for the agreement which be draw tip at the locarno conference when ratify these will represent the third step toward peace while they do not of themselves provide an economic rehabilitation which be necessary for the progress of europe by strengthen the guarantee of peace they diminish the need for great armament if the energy which now go into military effort be transfer to productive endeavor it will greatly assist economic progress the locarno agreement be make by the european country directly interested without any formal intervention of america although on july 3 1 publicly advocate such agreement in an address make in massachusetts we have consistently refrain from intervene except when our help have be seek and we have feel it could be effectively give as in the settlement of reparation and the london conference these recent locarno agreement represent the success of this policy which we have be insist ought to be adopt of have european country settle their own political problem without involve this country this beginning seem to demonstrate that this policy be sound it be exceedingly gratifying to observe this progress both in its method and in its result promise so much that be beneficial to the world when these agreement be finally adopt they will provide guarantee of peace that make the present prime reliance upon force in some part of europe very much less necessary the natural corollary to these treaty should be further international contract for the limitation of armament this work be successfully begin at the washington conference nothing be do at that time concern land force because of european objection our stand army have be reduce to around 118,000 about the necessary police force for 115,000,000 people we be not propose to increase it nor be it supposable that any foreign country look with the slight misapprehension upon our land force they do not menace anybody they be rather a protection to everybody the question of disarm upon land be so peculiarly european in its practical aspect that our country would look with particular gratitude upon any action which those country might take to reduce their own military force this be in accordance with our policy of not intervene unless the european power be unable to agree and make request for our assistance whenever they be able to agree of their own accord it be especially gratify to its and such agreement may be sure of our sympathetic support it seem clear that it be the reduction of army rather than of navy that be of the first importance to the world at the present time we shall look with great satisfaction upon that effort and give it our approbation and encouragement if that can be settle we may more easily consider further reduction and limitation of naval armament for that purpose our country have constantly through its executive and through repeat act of congress indicate its willingness to call such a conference under congressional sanction it would seem to be wise to participate in any conference of the great power for naval limitation of armament propose upon such condition that it would hold a fair promise of be effective the general policy of our country be for disarmament and it ought not to hesitate to adopt any practical plan that might reasonably be expect to succeed but it would not care to attend a conference which from its location or constituency would in all probability prove futile in the further pursuit of strengthen the bond of peace and good will we have join with other nation in an international conference hold at geneva and sign an agreement which will be lay before the senate for ratification provide suitable measure for control and for publicity in international trade in arm ammunition and implement of war and also execute a protocol providing for a prohibition of the use of poison gas in war in accordance with the principle of article 5 of the treaty relate thereto sign at tile washington conference we be support the pan american effort that be be make toward the codification of international law and look with sympathy oil the investigation conduct under philanthropic auspex of the proposal to agreement outlaw war in accordance with promise make at the washington conference we have urge the calling of and be now represent at the chinese customs conference and on the commission on extraterritoriality where it will be our policy so far as possible to meet the aspiration of china in all way consistent with the interest of the country involve court of international justice pende before the senate for nearly three year be the proposal to adhere to the protocol establish the permanent court of international justice a well establish line of precedent mark america 's effort to effect the establishment of it court of this nature we take a leading part in lay the foundation on which it rest in the establishment of the hague court of arbitration it be that tribunal which nominate the judge who be elect by tile council and assembly of the league of nations the proposal submit to the senate be make dependent upon four condition the first of which be that by support the court we do not assume any obligation under the league second that we may participate upon an equality with other states in the election of judge third that the congress shall determine what part of the expense we shall bear fourth that the statute create tile court shall not be amend without out consent and to these i have propose an additional condition to the effect that we be not to be bind by advisory opinion render without our consent the court appear to be independent of the league it be true tile judge be elect by tile assembly and council but they be nominate by the court of arbitration which we assist to create and of which we be a part the court be create by it statute so call which be really a treaty make among some forty eight different country that might properly be call a constitution of the court this statute provide a method by which the judge be choose so that when the court of arbitration nominate they and the assembly and council of the league elect they they be not act as instrument of the court of arbitration or instrument of the league but as instrument of the statute this will be even more apparent if our representative sit with the member of the council and assembly in elect the judge it be true they be pay through the league though not by the league but by the country which be member of the league and by our country if we accept the protocol the judge be pay by the league only in the same sense that it could be say united states judge be pay by the congress the court derive all its authority from the statute and be so completely independent of the league that it could go on function if the league be disband at least until the term of the judge expire the most careful provision be make in the statute as to the qualification of judge those who make the nomination be recommend to consult with their high court of justice their law school and academy the judge must be person of high moral character qualified to hold the high judicial office in that country or be jurisconsult of recognize competence in international law it must be assume that these requirement will continue to be carefully meet and with america join the country already concern it be difficult to comprehend how human ingenuity could well provide for the establishment of a court which would maintain its independence it have to be recognize that independence be to a considerable extent a matter of ability character and personality some effort be make in the early beginning to interfere with the independence of our supreme court it do not succeed because of the quality of the man who make up that tribunal it do not seem that the authority to give advisory opinion interfere with the independence of the court advisory opinion in and of themselves be not harmful but may be use in such a way as to be very beneficial because they undertake to prevent injury rather than merely afford a remedy after the injury have be do as a principle that only imply that the court shall function when proper application be make to it decide the question involve upon issue submit for an advisory opinion do not differ materially from decide the question involve upon issue submit by contend party up to the present time the court have give an advisory opinion when it judge it have jurisdiction and refuse to give one when it judge it do not have jurisdiction nothing in the work of the court have yet be an indication that this be an impairment of its independence or that its practice differ materially from the giving of like opinion under the authority of the constitution of several of our states no provision of the statute seem to i to give this court any authority to be a political rather than a judicial court we have bring case in this country before our court which when they have be adjudge to be political have be thereby dismiss it be not improbable that political question will be submit to this court but again up to the present time the court have refuse to pass on political question and our support would undoubtedly have a tendency to strengthen it in that refusal we be not propose to subject ourselves to any compulsory jurisdiction if we support the court we can never be oblige to submit any case which involve our interest for its decision our appearance before it would always be voluntary for the purpose of present a case which we have agree might be present there isno more danger that other might bring case before the court involve our interest which we do not wish to have bring after we have adhere and probably not so much than there would be of bring such case if we do not adhere i think that we would have the same legal or moral right to disregard such a finding in the one case that we would in the other if we be go to support any court it will not be one that we have set tip alone or which reflect only our ideal other nation have their custom and their institution their thought and their method of life if a court be go to be international its composition will have to yield to what be good in all these various element neither will it be possible to support a court which be exactly perfect or under which we assume absolutely no obligation if we be seek that opportunity we might as well declare that we be oppose to support any court if any agreement be make it will be because it undertake to set up a tribunal which can do some of the thing that other nation wish to have do we shall not find ourselves bear a disproportionate share of the world 's burden by our adherence and we may as well remember that there be absolutely no escape for our country from bear its share of the world 's burden in any case we shall do far well service to ourselves and to other if we admit this and discharge our duty voluntarily than if we deny it and be force to meet the same obligation unwillinglyit be difficult to imagine anything that would be more helpful to the world than stability tranquility and international justice we may say that we be contribute to these factor independently but other less fortunately locate do not and can not make a like contribution except through mutual cooperation the old balance of power mutual alliance and great military force be not bring bout by any mutual dislike for independence but result from the domination of circumstance ultimately they be force on we like all other engage in the war whatever we say as a matter of fact we join an alliance we become a military power we impair our independence we have more at stake than any one else in avoid a repetition of that calamity war do not spring into existence they arise from small incident and trifle irritation which can be adjust by an international court we can contribute greatly to the advancement of our ideal by join with other nation in maintain such a tribunal foreign debt gradually settlement have be make which provide for the liquidation of debt due to our government from foreign government those make with great britain finland hungary lithuania and poland have already be approve by the congress since the adjournment further agreement have be enter into with belgium czechoslovakia latvia estonia italy and rumania these 11 nation which have already make settlement represent $ 6,419,528,641 of the original principal of the loan the principal sum without interest still pende be the debt of france of $ 3,340,000,000 greece $ 15,000,000 yugoslavia $ .51,000,000 liberia $ 26,000 russia $ 192,000,000 which those at present in control have undertake openly to repudiate nicaragua $ 84,000 which be be pay currently and austria $ 24,000,000 on which by act of congress a moratorium of 20 year have be grant the only remain sum be $ 12,000,000 due from armenia which have now cease to exist as an independent nation in accordance with the settlement make the amount of principal and interest which be to be pay to the united states under these agreement aggregate $ 15,200,688,253.93 it be obvious that the remain settlement which will undoubtedly be make will bring this sum up to an amount which will more than equal the principal due on our present national debt while these settlement be very large in the aggregate it have be feel that the term grant be in all case very generous they impose no undue burden and be mutually beneficial in the observance of international faith and the improvement of international credit every reasonable effort will be make to secure agreement for liquidation with the remain country whenever they be in such condition that they can be make those which have already be negotiate under the bipartisan commission establish by the congress have be make only after the most thoroughgoing and painstaking investigation continue for a long time before meet with the representative of the country concern it be believe that they represent in each instance the good that can be do and the wise settlement that can be secure one very important result be the stabilization of foreign currency make exchange assist rather than embarrass our trade wherever sacrifice have be make of money it will be more than amply return in well understanding and friendship while in so far as these adjustment will contribute to the financial stability of the debtor country to their good order prosperity and progress they represent hope of improved trade relation and mutual contribution to the civilization of the world alien problem negotiation be progress among the interested party in relation to the final distribution of the asset in the hand of the alien property custodian our government and people be interested as creditor the german government and people be interested as debtor and owner of the seize property pende the outcome of these negotiation i do not recommend any affirmative legislation for the present we should continue in possession of this property which we hold as security for the settlement of claim due to our people and our government immigration while not enough time have elapse to afford a conclusive demonstration such result as have be secure indicate that our immigration law be on the whole beneficial it be undoubtedly a protection to the wage earner of this country the situation should however be carefully survey in order to ascertain whether it be work a needless hardship upon our own inhabitant if it deprive they of the comfort and society of those bind to they by close family tie such modification should be adopt as will afford relief always in accordance with the principle that our government owe its first duty to our own people and that no alien inhabitant of another country have any legal right whatever under our constitution and law it be only through treaty or through residence here that such right accrue but we should not however be forgetful of the obligation of a common humanity while our country number among its good citizen many of those of foreign birth yet those who now enter in violation of our law bi that very act thereby place themselves in a class of undesirable t investigation reveal that any considerable number be come here in defiance of our immigration restriction it will undoubtedly create the necessity for the registration of all alien we ought to have no prejudice against an alien because lie be an alien the standard which we apply to our inhabitant be that of manhood not place of birth restrictive immigration be to a large degree for economic purpose it be apply in order that we may not have a large annual increment of good people within our border than we can weave into our economic fabric in such a way as to supply their need without undue injury to ourselves national defense never before in time of peace have our country maintain so large and effective a military force as it now have the army navy marine corps national guard and organized reserves represent a strength of about 558,400 man these force be well train well equip and high in morale a sound selective service act give broad authority for the mobilization in time of peril of all the resource of the country both person and material be need to perfect our defense policy in accordance with our ideal of equality the provision for more suitable housing to be pay for out of fund derive from the sale of excess land pende before the last congress ought to be bring forward and pass reasonable replacement ought to be make to maintain a sufficient ammunition reserve the navy have the full treaty tonnage of capital ship work be go forward in modernize the old one build aircraft carrier additional fleet submarine and fast scout cruiser but we be carefully avoid anything that might be construe as a competition in armament with other nation the joint army and navy maneuver at hawaii follow by the cruise of a full battle fleet to australia and new zealand be successfully carry out these demonstration reveal a most satisfactory condition of the ship and the man engage last year at my suggestion the general board of the navy make an investigation and report on the relation of aircraft to warship as a result authorization and appropriation be make for more scout cruiser and fleet submarine and for complete aircraft carrier and equip they with necessary plane additional training in aviation be begin at the military and naval academies a method of coordination and cooperation of the army and navy and the principal aircraft builder be be perfect at the suggestion of the secretaries of war and navy i appoint a special board to make a further study of the problem of aircraft the report of the air board ought to be reassure to the country gratify to the service and satisfactory to the congress it be thoroughly complete and represent the mature thought of the good talent in the country no radical change in organization of the service seem necessary the departments of war navy and commerce should each be provide with an additional assistant secretary not necessarily with statutory duty but who would be available under the direction of the secretary to give especial attention to air navigation we must have an air strength worthy of america provision should be make for two additional brigadier general for the army air service temporary rank correspond to their duty should be award to active fly officer in both army and navy aviation be of great importance both for national defense and commercial development we ought to proceed in its improvement by the necessary experiment and investigation our country be not behind in this art it have make record for speed and for the excellence of its plane it ought to go on maintain its manufacturing plant capable of rapid production give national assistance to tile la in out of airway equip itself with a moderate number of plane and keep an air force train to the high efficiency while i be a thorough believer in national defense and entirely committed to the policy of adequate preparation i be just as thoroughly oppose to instigate or participate in a policy of competitive armament nor do preparation mean a policy of militarizing our people and industry be solicitous for the cause of 0111 country and have great respect for the army and navy and foil the uniform wear by the man who stand ready at all time for our protection to encounter the danger and peril necessary to military service but all of these activity be to be take not in behalf of aggression but in behalf of peace they be the instrument by which we undertake to do our part to promote good will and support stability among all people veteran if any one desire to estimate the esteem in which the veteran of america be hold by their fellow citizen it be but necessary to remember that the current budget call for an expenditure of about $ 650,000.000 in their behalf this be nearly the amount of the total cost of the national government exclusive of the post office before we enter the last war at the two previous session of congress legislation affect veteran relief be enact and the law liberalize this legislation bring into be a number of new provision tend more nearly to meet the need of our veteran as well as afford the necessary authority to perfect the administration of these law experience with the new legislation so far have clearly demonstrate its constructive nature it have increase the benefit receive by many and bas make eligible for benefit many other direct disbursement to the veteran or his dependent exceed $ 21,000,000 have result which otherwise would not have be make the degree of utilization of our hospital have increase through make facility available to the incapacitate veteran regardless of service origin of the disability this new legislation also have bring about a marked improvement of service to the veteran the organization of ex service man have propose additional legislative change which you will consider but until the new law and the modification make at the last session of congress be give a more thorough test further change in the basic law should be few and make only after careful though sympathetic consideration the principal work now before the veterans bureau be the perfection of its organization and further improvement in service some minor legislative change be deem necessary to enable the bureau to retain that high grade of professional talent essential in handle the problem of the bureau such change as tend toward the improvement of service and the carry forward to completion of the hospital construction program be recommend for the consideration of the proper committee of congress with the enormous outlay that be now be make in behalf of the veteran and their dependent with a tremendous war debt still require great annual expenditure with the still high rate of taxation while every provision should be make for the relief of the disabled and the necessary care of dependent the congress may well consider whether the financial condition of the government be not such that further bounty through the enlargement of general pension and other emolument ought not to be postpone agriculture no doubt the position of agriculture as a whole have very much improve since the depression of three and four year ago but there be many locality and many group of individual apparently through no fault of their own sometimes due to climatic condition and sometimes to the prevail price of a certain crop still in a distressing condition this be probably temporary but it be none the less acute national government agency the departments of agriculture and commerce the farm loan board the intermediate credit bank and the federal reserve board be all cooperate to be of assistance and relief on the other hand there be locality and individual who have have one of their most prosperous year the general price level be fair but here again there be exception both way some item be poor while other be excellent in spite of a lessen production the farm income for this year will be about the same as last year and much above the three precede year agriculture be a very complex industry it do not consist of one problem but of several they can not be solve at one stroke they have to be meet in different way and small gain be not to be despise it have appear from all the investigation that i have be able to make that the farmer as a whole be determined to maintain the independence of their business they do not wish to have meddle on the part of the government or to be place under the inevitable restriction involve in any system of direct or indirect price fixing which would result from permit the government to operate in the agricultural market they be show a very commendable skill in organize themselves to transact their own business through cooperative marketing which will this year turn over about $ 2,500,000,000 or nearly one fifth of the total agricultural business in this they be receive help from the government the department of agriculture should be strengthen in this facility in order to be able to respond when these marketing association want help while it ought not to undertake undue regulation it should be equip to give prompt information on crop prospect supply demand current receipt import export and price a bill embody these principle which have be draft under the advice and with the approval of substantially all the leader and manager in the cooperative movement will be present to the congress for its enactment legislation should also be consider to provide for lease the unappropriated public domain for graze purpose and adopt a uniform policy relative to graze on the public land and in the national forest a more intimate relation should be establish between agriculture and the other business activity of the nation they be mutually dependent and can each advance their own prosperity most by advance the prosperity of the other meantime the government will continue those activity which have result in an unprecedented amount of legislation and the pour out of great sum of money during the last five year the work for good road well land and water transportation increase support for agricultural education extension of credit facility through the farm loan boards and the intermediate credit bank the encouragement of orderly marketing and a repression of wasteful speculation will all be continue follow every other depression after a short period the price of farm produce have take and maintain the lead in the advance this advance have reach a climax before the war everyone will recall the discussion that go on for four or five year prior to 1914 concern the high cost of living this history be apparently begin to repeat itself while wholesale price of other commodity have be decline farm price have be increase there be every reason to suppose that a new era in agricultural prosperity lie just before we which will probably be unprecedented muscle shoals the problem of muscle shoals seem to i to have assume a place all out of proportion with its real importance it probably do not represent in market value much more than a first class battleship yet it have be discuss in the congress over a period of year and for month at a time it ought to be develop for the production of nitrate primarily and incidentally for power purpose this would serve defensive agricultural and industrial purpose i be in favor of dispose of this property to meet these purpose the finding of the special commission will be transmit to the congress for their information i be convinced that the good possible disposition can be make by direct authorization of the congress as a means of negotiation i recommend the immediate appointment of a small joint special committee choose from the appropriate general stand committee of the house and senate to receive bid which when make should be report with recommendation as to acceptance upon which a law should be enact effect a sale to the high bidder who will agree to carry out these purpose if anything be need to demonstrate the almost utter incapacity of the national government to deal directly with an industrial and commercial problem it have be provide by our experience with this property we have expend vast fortune we have tax everybody but we be unable to secure result which benefit anybody this property ought to be transfer to private management under condition which will dedicate it to the public purpose for which it be conceive reclamation the national government be commit to a policy of reclamation and irrigation which it desire to establish on a sound basis and continue in the interest of the locality concern exhaustive study have recently be make of federal reclamation which have result in improve the project and adjust many difficulty about one third of the project be in good financial condition another third can probably be make profitable while the other third be under unfavorable condition the congress have already provide for a survey which will soon be embody in a report that ought to suggest a method of relief which will make unnecessary further appeal to the congress unless this can be do federal reclamation will be considerably retarded with the greatly increase cost of construction and operation it have become necessary to plan in advance by community organization and selective agriculture method sufficient to repay these increase outlay the human and economic interest of the farmer citizen suggest that the states should be require to exert some effort and assume some responsibility especially in the intimate detailed and difficult work of secure settler and develop farm which directly profit they but only indirectly and remotely can reimburse the nation it be believe that the federal government should continue to be the agency for plan and construct the great undertaking need to regulate and bring into use the river the west many of which be interstate in character but the detailed work of create agricultural community and a rural civilization on the land make ready for reclamation ought to be either transfer to the state in its entirety or make a cooperative effort of the state and federal government ship the maintenance of a merchant marine be of the utmost importance for national defense and the service of our commerce we have a large number of ship engage in that service we also have a surplus supply costly to care for which ought to be sell all the investigation that have be make under my direction and those which have be prosecute independently have reach the conclusion that the fleet should be under the direct control of a single executive head while the shipping board should exercise its judicial and regulatory function in accordance with its original conception the report of henry g. dalton a business man of broad experience with a knowledge of shipping make to i after careful investigation will be transmit for the information of the congress the study pursue under the direction of the united states chamber of commerce will also be accessible and add to these will be the report of the special committee of the house i do not advocate the elimination of regional consideration but it have become apparent that without centralized executive action the management of this great business like the management of any other great business will flounder in incapacity and languish under a division of council a plain and unmistakable reassertion of this principle of unified control which i have always be advise be the intention of the congress to apply be necessary to increase the efficiency of our merchant fleet coal the perennial conflict in the coal industry be still go on to the great detriment of the wage earner the owner and especially to the public with deposit of coal in this country capable of supply its need for hundred of year inability to manage and control this great resource for the benefit of all concern be very close to a national economic failure it have be the subject of repeat investigation and reiterate recommendation yet the industry seem never to have accept modern method of adjust difference between employer and employee the industry could serve the public much well and become subject to a much more effective method of control if regional consolidation and more freedom in the formation of marketing association under the supervision of the department of commerce be permit at the present time the national government have little or no authority to deal with this vital necessity of the life of the country it have permit itself to remain so powerless that its only attitude must be humble supplication authority should be lodge with the president and the departments of commerce and labor give they power to deal with an emergency they should be able to appoint temporary board with authority to call for witness and document conciliate difference encourage arbitration and in case of threaten scarcity exercise control over distribution make the fact public under these circumstance through a statement from an authoritative source would be of great public benefit the report of the last coal commission should be bring forward reconsider and act upon prohibition under the orderly process of our fundamental institution the constitution be lately amend provide for national prohibition the congress pass an act for its enforcement and similar act have be provide by most of the states it be the law of the land it be the duty of all who come under its jurisdiction to observe the spirit of that law and it be the duty of the department of justice and the treasury department to enforce it action to prevent smuggling illegal transportation in interstate commerce abuse in the use of permit and existence of source of supply for illegal traffic be almost entirely impose upon the federal government through treaty with foreign government and increase activity of the coast guard revenue agent district attorney and enforcement agent effort be be make to prevent these violation but the constitution also put a concurrent duty on the states we need their active and energetic cooperation the vigilant action of their police and the jurisdiction of their court to assist in enforcement i request of the people observance of the public officer continue effort for enforcement and of the congress favorable action on the budget recommendation for the prosecution of this work waterway development for many year our country have be employ in plan and m for the development of our intracoastal and inland waterway this work along our coast be an important adjunct to our commerce it will be carry on together with the further opening up of our harbor as our resource permit the government make an agreement during the war to take over the cape cod canal under which the owner make valuable concession this pledge faith of the government ought to be redeem two other main field be under consideration one be the great lakes and st. lawrence include the erie canal this include stabilize the lake level and be both a waterway and power project a joint commission of the united states and canada be work on plan and survey which will not be complete until next april no final determination can be make apparently except under treaty as to the participation of both country the other be the mississippi river stem this be almost entirely devoted to navigation work on the ohio river will be complete in about three year a modern channel connect chicago new orleans kansas city and pittsburgh should be lay out and work on the tributary prosecute some work be be do of a preparatory nature along the missouri and large expenditure be be make yearly in the low reach of the mississippi and its tributary which contribute both to flood control and navigation preliminary measure be be take on tile colorado river project which be exceedingly important for flood control irrigation power development and water supply to the area concern it would seem to be very doubtful however whether it be practical to secure affirmative action of the congress except under a joint agreement of the several states the government have already expend large sum upon scientific research and engineering investigation in promotion of this colorado river project the actual progress have be retard for many year by difference among the seven states in the basin over their relative water right and among different group as to method in an attempt to settle the primary difficulty of the water right congress authorize the colorado river commission which agree on november 24 1922 upon an interstate compact to settle these right subject to the ratification of the state legislature and congress all seven state except arizona at one time ratify the arizona legislature make certain reservation which fail to meet the approval of the governor subsequently an attempt be make to establish the compact upon a six state basis but in this case california impose reservation there appear to be no division of opinion upon the major principle of the compact but difficulty in separate contention to method of development from the discussion of it it be imperative that flood control be undertake for california and arizona preparation make for irrigation for power and for domestic water some or all of these question be combine in every propose development the federal government be interested in some of these phase state government and municipality and irrigation district in other and private corporation in still other because of all this difference of view it be most desirable that congress should consider the creation of some agency that will be able to determine method of improvement solely upon economic and engineering fact that would be authorize to negotiate and settle subject to the approval of congress the participation right and obligation of each group in any particular work only by some such method can early construction be secure water power along with the development of navigation should go every possible encouragement for the development of our water power while steam still play a dominant part this be more and more become an era of electricity once instal the cost be moderate have not tend greatly to increase and be entirely free from the unavoidable dirt and disagreeable feature attendant upon the burning of coal every facility should be extend for the connection of the various unit into a superpower plant capable at all time of a current increase uniformity over the entire system railroads the railroad throughout the country be in a fair state of prosperity their service be good and their supply of car be abundant their condition would be improve and the public well serve by a system of consolidation i recommend that the congress authorize such consolidation tinder the supervision of the interstate commerce commission with power to approve or disapprove when propose part be exclude or new part add i be inform that the railroad manager and their employee have reach a substantial agreement as to what legislation be necessary to regulate and improve their relationship whenever they bring forward such proposal which seem sufficient also to protect the interest of the public they should be enact into law it be gratify to report that both the railroad manager and railroad employee be provide board for the mutual adjustment of difference in harmony with the principle of conference conciliation and arbitration the solution of their problem ought to be an example to all other industry those who ask the protection of civilization should be ready to use the method of civilization a strike in modern industry have many of the aspect of war in the modern world it injure labor and it injure capital if the industry involve be a basic one it reduce the necessary economic surplus and increase the cost of living it injure the economic welfare and general comfort of the whole people it also involve a deep cost it tend to embitter and divide the community into war class and thus weaken the unity and power of our national life labor can make no permanent gain at the cost of the general welfare all the victory win by organize labor in the past generation have be win through the support of public opinion the manifest inclination of the manager and employee of the railroad to adopt a policy of action in harmony with these principle mark a new epoch in our industrial life outlying possession the time have come for careful investigation of the expenditure and success of the law by which we have undertake to administer our outlying possession a very large amount of money be be expend for administration in alaska it appear so far out of proportion to the number of inhabitant and the amount of production as to indicate cause for thorough investigation likewise consideration should be give to the experience under the law which govern the philippines from such report as reach i there be indication that more authority should be give to the governor general so that he will not be so dependent upon the local legislative body to render effective our effort to set an example of the sound administration and good government which be so necessary for the preparation of the philippine people for self government under ultimate independence if they be to be train in these art it be our duty to provide for they the good that there be retirement of judges the act of march 3 1911 ought to be amend so that the term of year of service of judge of any court of the united states requisite for retirement with pay shall 6e compute to include not only continuous but aggregate service mother aid the government ought always to be alert on the side of the humanity it ought to encourage provision for economic justice for the defenseless it ought to extend its relief through its national and local agency as may be appropriate in each case to the suffering and the needy it ought to be charitable although more than 40 of our states have enact measure in aid of motherhood the district of columbia be still without such a law a carefully consider bill will be present which ought to have most thoughtful consideration in order that the congress may adopt a measure which will be hereafter a model for all part of the union civil service in 1883 the congress pass the civil service act which from a modest beginning of 14,000 employee have grow until there be now 425,000 in the classified service this have remove the clerical force of the nation from the wasteful effect of the spoils system and make it more stable and efficient the time have come to consider classify all postmaster collector of custom collector of internal revenue and prohibition agent by an act cover in those at present in office except when otherwise provide by executive order the necessary statistic be now be gather to form the basis of a valuation of the civil service retirement fund base on current condition of the service it be confidently expect that this valuation will be complete in time to be make available to the congress during the present session it will afford definite knowledge of exist and future liability under the present law and determination of liability under any propose change in the present law we should have this information before create further obligation for retirement annuity which will become liability to be meet in the future from the money of the taxpayer the classification act of 1923 with the subsequent legislative action provide for adjustment of the compensation of field service position have operate materially to improve employment condition in the federal service the administration of the act be in the hand of an impartial board function without the necessity of a direct appropriation it would be inadvisable at this time to place in other hand the administration of this act federal trade commission the proper function of the federal trade commission be to supervise and correct those practice in commerce which be detrimental to fair competition in this it perform a useful function and should be continue and support it be design also to be a help to honest business in my message to the sixty eighth congress i recommend that change in the procedure then exist be make since then the commission by its own action have reform its rule give great speed and economy in the disposal of its case and full opportunity for those accuse to be hear these change be improvement and if necessary provision should be make for their permanency reorganization no final action have yet be take on the measure provide for the reorganization of the various department i therefore suggest that this measure which will be of great benefit to the efficient and economical administration of the business of the government be bring forward and pass the negro nearly one tenth of our population consist of the negro race the progress which they have make in all the art of civilization in the last 60 year be almost beyond belief our country have no more loyal citizen but they do still need sympathy kindness and helpfulness they need reassurance that the requirement of the government and society to deal out to they even hand justice will be meet they should be protect from all violence and support in the peaceable enjoyment of the fruit of their labor those who do violence to they should be punish for their crime no other course of action be worthy of the american people our country have many element in its population many different mode of thinking and living all of which be strive in their own way to be loyal to the high ideal worthy of the crown of american citizenship it be fundamental of our institution that they seek to guarantee to all our inhabitant the right to live their own life under the protection of the public law this do not include any license to injure other materially physically morally to incite revolution or to violate the establish custom which have long bad the sanction of enlightened society but it do mean the full right to liberty and equality before the law without distinction of race or creed this condition can not be grant to other or enjoy by ourselves except by the application of the principle of broad tolerance bigotry be only another name for slavery it reduce to serfdom not only those against whom it be direct but also those who seek to apply it an enlarged freedom can only be secure by the application of the golden rule no other utterance ever present such a practical rule of life conclusion it be apparent that we be reach into an era of great general prosperity it will continue only so long as we shall use it properly after all there be but a fix quantity of wealth in this country at any fix time the only way that we can all secure more of it be to create more the element of time enter into production if the people have sufficient moderation and contentment to be willing to improve their condition by the process of enlarge production eliminate waste and distribute equitably a prosperity almost without limit lie before its if the people be to be dominate by selfishness seek immediate rich by nonproductive speculation and by wasteful quarrel over the return from industry they will be confront by the inevitable result of depression and privation if they will continue industrious and thrifty content with fair wage and moderate profit and the return which accrue from tile development of oar natural resource our prosperity will extend itself indefinitely in all your deliberation you should remember that the purpose of legislation be to translate principle into action it be an effort to have our country be well by do well because the thought and way of people be firmly fix and not easily change the field within which immediate improvement can be secure be very narrow legislation can provide opportunity whether it be take advantage of or not depend upon the people themselves the government of the united states have be create by the people it be solely responsible to they it will be most successful if it be conduct solely for their benefit all its effort would be of little avail unless they bring more justice more enlightenment more happiness and prosperity into the home this mean an opportunity to observe religion secure education and earn a living under a reign of law and order it be the growth and improvement of the material and spiritual life of the nation we shall not be able to gain these end merely by our own action if they come at all it will be because we have be willing to work in harmony with the abide purpose of a divine providence
fellow countrymen
 we meet to celebrate the birthday of america that come of a new life always excite our interest although we know in the case of the individual that it have be an infinite repetition reach back beyond our vision that only make it more wonderful but how our interest and wonder increase when we behold the miracle of the birth of a new nation it be to pay our tribute of reverence and respect to those who participate in such a mighty event that we annually observe the 4th day of july whatever may have be the impression create by the news which go out from this city on that summer day in 1776 there can be no doubt as to the estimate which be now place upon it at the end of 150 year the four corner of the earth unite in come to philadelphia as to a holy shrine in grateful acknowledgment of a service so great which a few inspire man here render to humanity that it be still the preeminent support of free government throughout the world
 although a century and a half measure in comparison with the length of human experience be but a short time yet measure in the life of government and nation it rank as a very respectable period certainly enough time have elapse to demonstrate with a great real of thoroughness the value of our institution and their dependability as rule for the regulation of human conduct and the advancement of civilization they have be in existence long enough to become very well seasoned they have meet and meet successfully the test of experience
 it be not so much then for the purpose of undertake to proclaim new theory and principle that this annual celebration be maintain but rather to reaffirm and reestablish those old theory and principle which time and the unerre logic of event have demonstrate to be sound amid all the clash of conflict interest amid all the welter of partisan politic every american can turn for solace and consolation to the declaration of independence and the constitution of the united states with the assurance and confidence that those two great charter of freedom and justice remain firm and unshaken whatever peril appear whatever danger threaten the nation remain secure in the knowledge that the ultimate application of the law of the land will provide an adequate defense and protection
 it be little wonder that people at home and abroad consider independence hall as hallowed ground and revere the liberty bell as a sacred relic that pile of brick and mortar that mass of metal might appear to the uninstructed as only the outgrown meeting place and the shattered bell of a former time useless now because of more modern convenience but to those who know they have become consecrate by the use which man have make of they they have long be identify with a great cause they be the framework of a spiritual event the world look upon they because of their association of one hundred and fifty year ago as it look upon the holy land because of what take place there nineteen hundred year ago through use for a righteous purpose they have become sanctify
 it be not here necessary to examine in detail the cause which lead to the american revolution in their immediate occasion they be largely economic the colonist object to the navigation law which interfere with their trade they deny the power of parliament to impose taxis which they be oblige to pay and they therefore resist the royal governor and the royal force which be send to secure obedience to these law but the conviction be inescapable that a new civilization have come a new spirit have arise on this side of the atlantic more advanced and more develop in its regard for the right of the individual than that which characterize the old world life in a new and open country have aspiration which could not be realize in any subordinate position a separate establishment be ultimately inevitable it have be decree by the very law of human nature man everywhere have an unconquerable desire to be the master of his own destiny
 we be oblige to conclude that the declaration of independence represent the movement of a people it be not of course a movement from the top revolution do not come from that direction it be not without the support of many of the most respectable people in the colonies who be entitle to all the consideration that be give to breeding education and possession it have the support of another element of great significance and importance to which i shall later refer but the preponderance of all those who occupy a position which take on the aspect of aristocracy do not approve of the revolution and hold toward it an attitude either of neutrality or open hostility it be in no sense a rise of the oppressed and downtrodden it bring no scum to the surface for the reason that colonial society have develop no scum the great body of the people be accustom to privation but they be free from depravity if they have poverty it be not of the hopeless kind that afflict great city but the inspiring kind that mark the spirit of the pioneer the american revolution represent the informed and mature conviction of a great mass of independent liberty loving god fear people who know their right and possess the courage to dare to maintain they
 the continental congress be not only compose of great man but it represent a great people while its member do not fail to exercise a remarkable leadership they be equally observant of their representative capacity they be industrious in encourage their constituent to instruct they to support independence but until such instruction be give they be inclined to withhold action
 while north carolina have the honor of first authorize its delegate to concur with other colonies in declare independence it be quickly follow by south carolina and georgia which also give general instruction broad enough to include such action but the first instruction which unconditionally direct its delegate to declare for independence come from the great commonwealth of virginia these be immediately follow by rhode island and massachusetts while the other colonies with the exception of new york soon adopt a like course
 this obedience of the delegate to the wish of their constituent which in some case cause they to modify their previous position be a matter of great significance it reveal an orderly process of government in the first place but more than that it demonstrate that the declaration of independence be the result of the seasoned and deliberate thought of the dominant portion of the people of the colonies adopt after long discussion and as the result of the duly authorize expression of the preponderance of public opinion it do not partake of dark intrigue or hidden conspiracy it be well advised it have about it nothing of the lawless and disorder nature of a riotous insurrection it be maintain on a plane which rise above the ordinary conception of rebellion it be in no sense a radical movement but take on the dignity of a resistance to illegal usurpation it be conservative and represent the action of the colonist to maintain their constitutional right which from time immemorial have be guarantee to they under the law of the land
 when we come to examine the action of the continental congress in adopt the declaration of independence in the light of what be set out in that great document and in the light of succeed event we can not escape the conclusion that it have a much broad and deep significance than a mere secession if territory and the establishment of a new nation event of that nature have be take place since the dawn of history one empire after another have arise only to crumble away as its constituent part separate from each other and set up independent government of their own such action long ago become commonplace they have occur too often to hold the attention of the world and command the administration and reverence of humanity there be something beyond the establishment of a new nation great as that event would be in the declaration of independence which have ever since cause it to be regard as one of the great charter that not only be to liberate america but be everywhere to ennoble humanity
 it be not because it be propose to establish a new nation but because it be propose to establish a nation on new principle that july 4 1776 have come to be regard as one of the great day in history great idea do not burst upon the world unannounced they be reach by a gradual development over a length of time usually proportionate to their importance this be especially true of the principle lay down in the declaration of independence three very definite proposition be set out in its preamble regard the nature of mankind and therefore of government these be the doctrine that all man be create equal that they be endow with certain inalienable right and that therefore the source of the just power of government must be derive from the consent of the govern
 if no one be to be account as bear into a superior station if there be to be no rule class and if all possess right which can neither be barter away nor take from they by any earthly power it follow as a matter of course that the practical authority of the government have to rest on the consent of the govern while these principle be not altogether new in political action and be very far from new in political speculation they have never be assemble before and declare in such a combination but remarkable as this may be it be not the chief distinction of the declaration of independence the importance of political speculation be not to be underestimate as i shall presently disclose until the idea be develop and the plan make there can be no action
 it be the fact that our declaration of independence contain these immortal truth be the political action of a duly authorize and constitute representative public body in its sovereign capacity support by the force of general opinion and by the army of washington already in the field which make it the most important civil document in the world it be not only the principle declare but the fact that therewith a new nation be bear which be to be found upon those principle and which from that time forth in its development have actually maintain those principle that make this pronouncement an incomparable event in the history of government it be an assertion that a people have arise determine to make every necessary sacrifice for the support of these truth and by their practical application bring the war of independence to a successful conclusion and adopt the constitution of the united states with all that it have mean to civilization
 the idea that the people have a right to choose their own ruler be not new in political history it be the foundation of every popular attempt to depose an undesirable king this right be set out with a good deal of detail by the dutch when as early as july 26 1581 they declare their independence of philip of spain in their long struggle with the stuarts the british people assert the same principle which finally culminate in the bill of rights depose the last of that house and place william and mary on the throne in each of these case sovereignty through divine right be displace by sovereignty through the consent of the people run through the same document though express in different term be the clear inference of inalienable right but we should search these charter in vain for an assertion of the doctrine of equality this principle have not before appear as an official political declaration of any nation it be profoundly revolutionary it be one of the corner stone of american institution
 but if these truth to which the declaration refer have not before be adopt in their combine entirely by national authority it be a fact that they have be long ponder and often express in political speculation it be generally assume that french thought have some effect upon our public mind during revolutionary day this may have be true but the principle of our declaration have be under discussion in the colonies for nearly two generation before the advent of the french political philosophy that characterize the middle of the eighteenth century in fact they come from an early date a very positive echo of what the dutch have do in 1581 and what the english be prepare to do appear in the assertion of the rev. thomas hooker of connecticut as early as 1638 when he say in a sermon before the general court that--
 the foundation of authority be lay in the free consent of the people
 the choice of public magistrate belong to the people by god&#39;s own allowance
 this doctrine find wide acceptance among the nonconformist clergy who later make up the congregational church the great apostle of this movement be the rev. john wise of massachusetts he be one of the leader of the revolt against the royal governor andross in 1687 for which he suffer imprisonment he be a liberal in ecclesiastical controversy he appear to have be familiar with the writing of the political scientist samuel pufendorf who be bear in saxony in 1632 wise publish a treatise entitle the church&#39;s quarrel espouse in 1710 which be amplify in another publication in 1717 in it he deal with the principle of civil government his work be reprint in 1772 and have be declare to have be nothing less than a textbook of liberty for our revolutionary father
 while the write word be the foundation it be apparent that the speak word be the vehicle for convince the people this come with great force and wide range from the successor of hooker and wise it be carry on with a missionary spirit which do not fail to reach the scotch irish of north carolina show its influence by significantly make that colony the first to give instruction to its delegate look to independence this preaching reach the neighborhood of thomas jefferson who acknowledge that his good idea of democracy have be secure at church meeting
 that these idea be prevalent in virginia be far reveal by the declaration of rights which be prepare by george mason and present to the general assembly on may 27 1776 this document assert popular sovereignty and inherent natural right but confine the doctrine of equality to the assertion that all man be create equally free and independent it can scarcely be imagine that jefferson be unacquainted with what have be do in his own commonwealth of virginia when he take up the task of draft the declaration of independence but these thought can very largely be trace back to what john wise be write in 1710 he say every man must be acknowledge equal to very man again the end of all good government be to cultivate humanity and promote the happiness of all and the good of every man in all his right his life liberty estate honor and so forth
 and again for as they have a power every man in his natural state so upon combination they can and do bequeath this power to other and settle it accord as their united discretion shall determine and still again democracy be christ&#39;s government in church and state here be the doctrine of equality popular sovereignty and the substance of the theory of inalienable right clearly assert by wise at the opening of the eighteenth century just as we have the principle of the consent of the governed state by hooker as early as 1638
 when we take all these circumstance into consideration it be but natural that the first paragraph of the declaration of independence should open with a reference to nature&#39;s god and should close in the final paragraph with an appeal to the supreme judge of the world and an assertion of a firm reliance on divine providence come from these source have as it do this background it be no wonder that samuel adams could say the people seem to recognize this resolution as though it be a decree promulgate from heaven
 no one can examine this record and escape the conclusion that in the great outline of its principle the declaration be the result of the religious teaching of the precede period the profound philosophy which jonathan edwards apply to theology the popular preaching of george whitefield have arouse the thought and stir the people of the colonies in preparation for this great event no doubt the speculation which have be go on in england and especially on the continent lend their influence to the general sentiment of the time of course the world be always influence by all the experience and all the thought of the past but when we come to a contemplation of the immediate conception of the principle of human relationship which go into the declaration of independence we be not require to extend our search beyond our own shore they be find in the text the sermon and the writing of the early colonial clergy who be earnestly undertake to instruct their congregation in the great mystery of how to live they preach equality because they believe in the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man they justify freedom by the text that we be all create in the divine image all partaker of the divine spirit
 place every man on a plane where he acknowledge no superior where no one possess any right to rule over he he must inevitably choose his own ruler through a system of self government this be their theory of democracy in those day such doctrine would scarcely have be permit to flourish and spread in any other country this be the purpose which the father cherish in order that they might have freedom to express these thought and opportunity to put they into action whole congregation with their pastor have migrate to the colonies these great truth be in the air that our people breathe whatever else we may say of it the declaration of independence be profoundly american
 if this apprehension of the fact be correct and the documentary evidence would appear to verify it then certain conclusion be bind to follow a spring will cease to flow if its source be dry up a tree will wither if it root be destroy in its main feature the declaration of independence be a great spiritual document it be a declaration not of material but of spiritual conception equality liberty popular sovereignty the right of man these be not element which we can see and touch they be ideal they have their source and their root in the religious conviction they belong to the unseen world unless the faith of the american people in these religious conviction be to endure the principle of our declaration will perish we can not continue to enjoy the result if we neglect and abandon the cause
 we be too prone to overlook another conclusion government do not make ideal but ideal make government this be both historically and logically true of course the government can help to sustain ideal and can create institution through which they can be the well observe but their source by their very nature be in the people the people have to bear their own responsibility there be no method by which that burden can be shift to the government it be not the enactment but the observance of law that create the character of a nation
 about the declaration there be a finality that be exceedingly restful it be often assert that the world have make a great deal of progress since 1776 that we have have new thought and new experience which have give we a great advance over the people of that day and that we may therefore very well discard their conclusion for something more modern but that reasoning can not be apply to this great charter if all man be create equal that be final if they be endow with inalienable right that be final if government derive their just power from the consent of the govern that be final no advance no progress can be make beyond these proposition if anyone wish to deny their truth or their soundness the only direction in which he can proceed historically be not forward but backward toward the time when there be no equality no right of the individual no rule of the people those who wish to proceed in that direction can not lay claim to progress they be reactionary their idea be not more modern but more ancient than those of the revolutionary father
 in the development of its institution america can fairly claim that it have remain true to the principle which be declare 150 year ago in all the essential we have achieve an equality which be never possess by any other people even in the less important matter of material possession we have secure a wide and wide distribution of wealth the right of the individual be hold sacred and protect by constitutional guaranty which even the government itself be bind not to violate if there be any one thing among we that be establish beyond question it be self government the right of the people to rule if there be any failure in respect to any of these principle it be because there be a failure on the part of individual to observe they we hold that the duly authorize expression of the will of the people have a divine sanction but even in that we come back to the theory of john wise that democracy be christ&#39;s government the ultimate sanction of law rest on the righteous authority of the almighty
 on an occasion like this great temptation exist to present evidence of the practical success of our form of democratic republic at home and the ever broaden acceptance it be secure abroad although these thing be well know their frequent consideration be an encouragement and an inspiration but it be not result and effect so much as source and cause that i believe it be even more necessary constantly to contemplate ours be a government of the people it represent their will its officer may sometimes go astray but that be not a reason for criticize the principle of our institution the real heart of the american government depend upon the heart of the people it be from that source that we must look for all genuine reform it be to that cause that we must ascribe all our result
 it be in the contemplation of these truth that the father make their declaration and adopt their constitution it be to establish a free government which must not be permit to degenerate into the unrestrained authority of a mere majority or the unbridled weight of a mere influential few they undertake to balance these interest against each other and provide the three separate independent branch the executive the legislative and the judicial department of the government with check against each other in order that neither one might encroach upon the other these be our guarantee of liberty as a result of these method enterprise have be duly protect from confiscation the people have be free from oppression and there have be an ever broaden and deepening of the humanity of life
 under a system of popular government there will always be those who will seek for political preferment by clamor for reform while there be very little of this which be not sincere there be a large portion that be not well informed in my opinion very little of just criticism can attach to the theory and principle of our institution there be far more danger of harm than there be hope of good in any radical change we do need a well understanding and comprehension of they and a well knowledge of the foundation of government in general our forefather come to certain conclusion and decide upon certain course of action which have be a great blessing to the world before we can understand their conclusion we must go back and review the course which they follow we must think the thought which they think their intellectual life center around the meetinghouse they be intent upon religious worship while there be always among they man of deep learning and later those who have comparatively large possession the mind of the people be not so much engross in how much they know or how much they have as in how they be go to live while scantily provide with other literature there be a wide acquaintance with the scripture over a period as great as that which measure the existence of our independence they be subject to this discipline not only in their religious life and educational training but also in their political thought they be a people who come under the influence of a great spiritual development and acquire a great moral power
 no other theory be adequate to explain or comprehend the declaration of independence it be the product of the spiritual insight of the people we live in an age of science and of abound accumulation of material thing these do not create our declaration our declaration create they the thing of the spirit come first unless we cling to that all our material prosperity overwhelming though it may appear will turn to a barren scepter in our grasp if we be to maintain the great heritage which have be bequeath to we we must be like minded as the father who create it we must not sink into a pagan materialism we must cultivate the reverence which they have for the thing that be holy we must follow the spiritual and moral leadership which they show we must keep replenish that they may glow with a more compelling flame the altar fire before which they worship

member of the congress in report to the congress the state of the union i find it impossible to characterize it other than one of general peace and prosperity in some quarter our diplomacy be vex with difficult and as yet unsolved problem but nowhere be we meet with armed conflict if some occupation and area be not flourish in none do there remain any acute chronic depression what the country require be not so much new policy as a steady continuation of those which be already be crown with such abundant success it can not be too often repeat that in common with all the world we be engage in liquidate the war in the present short session no great amount of new legislation be possible but in order to comprehend what be most desirable some survey of our general situation be necessary a large amount of time be consume in the passage of appropriation bill if each congress in its opening session would make appropriation to continue for two year very much time would be save which could either be devoted to a consideration of the general need of the country or would result in decrease the work of legislation economy our present state of prosperity have be greatly promote by three important cause one of which be economy result in reduction and reform in national taxation another be the elimination of many kind of waste the third be a general raising of the standard of efficiency this combination have bring the perfectly astonishing result of a reduction in the index price of commodity and an increase in the index rate of wage we have secure a lowering of the cost to produce and a raising of the ability to consume prosperity result from these cause rest on the securest of all foundation it gather strength from its own progress in promote this progress the chief part which the national government play lie in the field of economy whatever doubt may have be entertain as to the necessity of this policy and the beneficial result which would accrue from it to all the people of the nation its wisdom must now be consider thoroughly demonstrate it may not have appear to be a novel or perhaps brilliant conception but it have turn out to be preeminently sound it hasnot fail to work it have surely bring result it do not have to be excuse as a temporary expedient adopt as the less evil to remedy some abuse it be not a palliative seeking to treat symptom but a major operation for the eradication at the source of a large number of social disease nothing be easy than the expenditure of public money it do not appear to belong to anybody the temptation be overwhelming to bestow it on somebody but the result of extravagance be ruinous the property of the country like the freedom of the country belong to the people of the country they have not empower their government to take a dollar of it except for a necessary public purpose but if the constitution confer such right sound economic would forbid it nothing be more destructive of the progress of the nation than government extravagance it mean an increase in the burden of taxation dissipation of the return from enterprise a decrease in the real value of wage with ultimate stagnation and decay the whole theory of our institution be base on the liberty and independence of the individual he be dependent on himself for support and therefore entitle to the reward of his own industry he be not to be deprive of what he earn that other may be benefit by what they do not earn what lie save through his private effort be not to be waste by government extravagance our national activity have become so vast that it be necessary to scrutinize each item of public expenditure if we be to apply the principle of economy at the last session we make an immediate increase in the annual budget of more than $ 100,000,000 in benefit confer on the veteran of three war public building and river and harbor improvement many project be be broach require far large outlay i be convinced that it would be greatly for the welfare of the country if we avoid at the present session all commitment except those of the most pressing nature from a reduction of the debt and taxis will accrue a wide benefit to all the people of this country than from embark on any new enterprise when our war debt be decrease we shall have resource for expansion until that be accomplish we should confine ourselves to expenditure of the most urgent necessity the department of commerce have perform a most important function in make plan and secure support of all kind of national enterprise for the elimination of waste efficiency have be greatly promote through good management and the constantly increase cooperation of the wage earner throughout the whole realm of private business it be my opinion that this whole development have be predicate on the foundation of a protective tariff tax reduction as a result of economy of administration by the executive and of appropriation by the congress the end of this fiscal year will leave a surplus in the treasury estimate at $ 383,000,000 unless otherwise order such surplus be use for the retirement of the war debt a bond which can be retire today for 100 cent will cost the people 104 1/4 cent to retire a year from now while i favor a speedy reduction of the debt as already require by law and in accordance with the promise make to the holder of our liberty bond when they be issue there be no reason why a balanced portion of surplus revenue should not be apply to a reduction of taxation it can not be repeat too often that the enormous revenue of this nation could not be collect without become a charge on all the people whether or not they directly pay taxis everyone who be pay or the bare necessity of fool and shelter and clothing without consider the well thing of life be indirectly pay a national tax the nearly 20,000,000 owner of security the additional score of million of holder of insurance policy and depositor in saving bank be all pay a national tax million of individual and corporation be make a direct contribution to the national treasury which run from 11/2 to 25 per cent of their income besides a number of special requirement like automobile and admission taxis whenever the state of the treasury will permit i believe in a reduction of taxation i think the taxpayer be entitle to it but i be not advocate tax reduction merely for the benefit of the taxpayer i be advocate it for the benefit of the country if it appear feasible i should welcome permanent tax reduction at this time the estimate surplus however for june 30 1928 be not much large than be require in a go business of nearly $ 4,000,000,000 we have have but a few month experience under the present revenue act and shall need to know what be develop by the return of income produce under it which be not require t o be make until about the time this session terminate and what the economic probability of the country be in the latter part of 1927 before we can reach any justifiable conclusion as to permanent tax reduction moreover the present surplus result from many nonrecurrent item meantime it be possible to grant some real relief by a simple measure make reduction in the payment which accrue on the 15th of march and june 1927 1 be very strongly of the conviction that this be so much a purely business matter that it ought not to be deal with in a partisan spirit the congress have already set the notable example of treat tax problem without much reference to party which might well be continue what i desire to advocate most earnestly be relief for the country from unnecessary tax burden we can not secure that if we stop to engage in a partisan controversy as i do not think any change in the special taxis or tiny permanent reduction be practical i therefore urge both party of the house ways and means committee to agree on a bill grant the temporary relief which i have indicate such a reduction would directly affect million of taxpayer release large sum for investment in new enterprise stimulate industrial production and agricultural consumption and indirectly benefit every family in the whole country these be my conviction state with full knowledge that it be for the congress to decide whether they judge it well to make such a reduction or leave the surplus for the present year to be apply to retirement of the war debt that also be eventually tax reduction protective tariff it be estimate that custom receipt for the present fiscal year will exceed $ 615,000,000 the large which be ever secure from that source the value of our import for the last fiscal year be $ 4,466,000,000 an increase of more than 71 per cent since the present tariff law go into effect of these import about 65 per cent or roughly $ 2,900,000,000 come in free of duty which mean that the united states afford a duty free market to other country almost equal in value to the total import of germany and greatly exceed the total import of france we have admit a great volume of free import than any other country except england we be therefore levy duty on about $ 1,550,000,000 of import nearly half of this or $ 700,000,000 be subject to duty for the protection of agriculture and have their origin in country other than europe they substantially increase the price receive by our farmer for their produce about $ 300,000.000 more be represent by luxury such as costly rug fur precious stone etc this leave only about $ 550,000,000 of our import under a schedule of duty which be in general under consideration when there be discussion of lower the tariff while the duty on this small portion represent only about 12 per cent of our import undoubtedly represent the difference between a fair degree of prosperity or mark depression to many of our industry and the difference between good pay and steady work or wide unemployment to many of our wage earner it be impossible to conceive how other country or our own importer could be greatly benefit if these duty be reduce those who be start an agitation for a reduction of tariff duty partly at least for the benefit of those to whom money have be lend abroad ought to know that there do not seem to be a very large field within the area of our import in which probable reduction would be advantageous to foreign good those who wish to benefit foreign producer be much more likely to secure that result by continue the present enormous purchasing power which come from our prosperity that hall increase our import over 71 per cent in four year than from any advantage that be likely to accrue from a general tariff reduction agriculture the important place which agriculture hold in the economic and social life of the nation can not be overestimate the national government be justify in put forth every effort to make the open country a desirable place to live no condition meet this requirement which fail to supply a fair return on labor expend and capital invest while some locality and some particular crop furnish exception in general agriculture be continue to make progress in recover from the depression of 1921 and 1922 animal product and food product be in a more encouraging position while cotton due to the high price of past year supplement by ideal weather condition have be stimulate to a point of temporary over production act on the request of the cotton grow interest appoint a committee to assist in carry out their plan as it result of this cooperation sufficient fund have be pledge to finance the storage and carrying of 4,000,000 bale of cotton whether those who own the cotton be willing to put a part of their stock into this plan depend on themselves the federal government have cooperate in provide ample facility no method of meet the situation would be adequate which do not contemplate a reduction of about one third in the acreage for the come year the responsibility for make the plan effective lie with those who own and finance cotton and cotton land the department of agriculture estimate the net income of agriculture for the year 1920 21 at only $ 375,000,000 for 1924 25 $ 2,656,000,000 for 1925 26 $ 2,757,000,000 this increase have be bring about in part by the method already refer to of federal tax reduction the elimination of waste and increase efficiency in industry the wide gap that exist a few year ago between the index price of agricultural product and the index price of other product have be gradually close up though the recent depression in cotton have somewhat enlarge it agriculture have on the whole be go high while industry have be grow low industrial and commercial activity be carry on for the most part by corporation be tax at a much high rate than farming which be carry on by individual this will inevitably make industrial commodity cost high while war taxation last it be because of this circumstance that national tax reduction have a very large indirect benefit upon the farmer though it can not relieve he from the very great burden of the local taxis which he pay directly we have practically relieve the farmer of any federal income tax there be agreement on all side that some portion of our agricultural industry have lag behind other industry in recovery from the war and that further improvement in method of marketing of agricultural product be most desirable there be belief also that the federal government can far contribute to these end beyond the many helpful measure take during the last five year through the different act of congress for advance the interest of the farmer the packer and stockyard act establish of the intermediate credit bank for agricultural purpose the purnell act for agricultural research the capper volstead cooperative marketing act the cooperative marketing act of 1926,amendments to the warehouse act the enlargement of the activity of the department of agriculture enlargement of the scope of loan by the farm loan board the tariff on agricultural product the large federal expenditure in improvement of waterway and highway the reduction of federal taxis in all comprise a great series of governmental action in the advancement of the special interest of agriculture in determination of what further measure may be undertake it seem to i there be certain pitfall which must be avoid and our test in avoid they should be to avoid disaster to the farmer himself act upon my recommendation the congress have order the interstate commerce commission to investigate the freight rate structure direct that such change shall be make in freight rate as will promote freedom of movement of agricultural product railroad consolidation which i be advocate would also result in a situation where rate could be make more advantageous for farm produce as have recently be do in the revision of rate on fertilizer in the south additional benefit will accrue from the development of our inland waterway the mississippi river system carry a commerce of over 50,000,000 ton at a saving of nearly $ 18,000,000 annually the inland waterways corporation operate boat on 2,500 mile of navigable stream and through its relation with 165 railroad carry freight into and out of 45 states of the union during the past six month it have handle over 1,000,000 bushel of grain monthly and by its low freight rate have raise the price of such grain to the farmer probably 21/2 cent to 3 cent a bushel the highway system on which the federal government expend about $ 85,000,000 a year be of vital importance to the rural region the advantage to be derive from a more comprehensive and less expensive system of transportation for agriculture ought to be supplement by provision for an adequate supply of fertilizer at a low cost than it be at present obtainable this advantage we be attempt to secure by the propose development at muscle shoals and there be promise experiment be make in synthetic chemistry for the production of nitrate a survey should be make of the relation of government graze land to the livestock industry additional legislation be desirable more definitely to establish the place of graze in the administration of the national forest properly subordinate to their function of produce timber and conserve the water supply over 180,000,000 acre of graze land be still pasture as common in the public domain with little or no regulation this have make their use so uncertain that it have contribute greatly to the instability of the livestock industry very little of this land be suit to settlement or private ownership some plan ought to be adopt for its use in grazing correspond broadly to that already successfully apply to the national forest the development of sound and strong cooperative association be of fundamental importance to our agriculture it be encouraging to note therefore that a vigorous and healthy growth in the cooperative movement be continue cooperative association report to the department of agriculture at the end of 1925 have on their membership roll a total of 2,700,000 producer their total business in 1925 amount to approximately $ 2,400,000,000 compare with $ 635,800,000 in 1915 legislative action to assist cooperative association and supplement their effort be pass at the last session of congress important credit measure be also provide by congress in 1923 which have be of inestimable value to the cooperative association although the federal credit agency have serve agriculture well i think it may be possible to broaden and strengthen the service of these institution attention be again direct to the surplus problem of agriculture by the present cotton situation surplus often affect price of various farm commodity in a disastrous manner and the problem urgently demand a solution discussion both in and out of congress during the past few year have give we a well understanding of the subject and it be my hope that out of the various proposal make the basis will be find for a sound and effective solution upon which agreement can be reach in my opinion cooperative marketing association will be important aid to the ultimate solution of the problem it may well be however that additional measure will be need to supplement their effort i believe all will agree that such measure should not conflict with the good interest of the cooperative but rather assist and strengthen they in work out this problem to any sound conclusion it be necessary to avoid put the government into the business of production or marketing or attempt to enact legislation for the purpose of price fixing the farmer do not favor any attempt remedy that partake of these element he have a sincere and candid desire for assistance if match by an equally sincere and candid consideration of the different remedy propose a sound measure of relief ought to result it be unfortunate that no general agreement have be reach by the various agricultural interest upon any of the propose remedy out of the discussion of various proposal which can be have before the committees of agriculture some measure ought to be perfect which would be generally satisfactory due to the emergency arise from a heavy tropical storm in southern florida i authorize the secretary of agriculture to use certain fund in anticipation of legislation to enable the farmer in that region to plant their crop the department will present a bill ratify the loan which be make for this purpose federal legislation have be adopt authorize the cooperation of the government with states and private owner in the protection of forest land from fire this preventive measure be of such great importance that i have recommend for it an increase appropriation another preventive measure of great economic and sanitary importance be the eradication of tuberculosis in cattle active work be now in progress in one fourth of the county of the united states to secure this result over 12,000,000 cattle have be under treatment and the average degree of infection have fall from 4.9 per cent to 2.8 per cent he federal government be make substantial expenditure for this purpose serious damage be threaten to the corn crop by the european corn borer since 1917 it have spread from eastern new england westward into indiana and now cover about 100,000 square mile it be one of the most formidable pest because it spread rapidly and be exceedingly difficult of control it have assume a menace that be of national magnitude and warrant the federal government in extend its cooperation to the state and local agency which be attempt to prevent its further spread and secure its eradication the whole question of agriculture need most careful consideration in the past few year the government have give this subject more attention than any other and have hold more consultation in relation to it than on any other subject while the government be not to be blame for failure to perform the impossible the agricultural region be entitle to know that they have its constant solicitude and sympathy many of the farmer be burden with debt and taxis which they be unable to carry we be expend in this country many million of dollar each year to increase farm production we ought now to put more emphasis on the question of farm marketing if a sound solution of a permanent nature can be find for this problem the congress ought not to hesitate to adopt it development of water resources in previous message i have refer to the national importance of the proper development of our water resource the great project of extension of the mississippi system the protection an development of the low colorado river be before congress and i have previously comment upon they i favor the necessary legislation to expedite these project engineering study be be make for connect the great lakes with the north atlantic either through an all american canal or by way of the st. lawrence river these report will undoubtedly be before the congress during its present session it be unnecessary to dwell upon the great importance of such a waterway not only to our mid continental basin but to the commerce and development of practically the whole nation our river and harbor improvement should be continue in accordance with the present policy expenditure of this character be compatible with economy it be in the nature of capital investment work should proceed on the basic trunk line if this work be to be a success if the country will be content to be moderate and patient and permit improvement to be make where they will do the great general good rather than insist on expenditure at this time on secondary project our internal waterways can be make a success if propose legislation result in a gross manifestation of local jealousy and selfishness this program can not be carry out ultimately we can take care of extension but our first effort should be confine to the main artery our inland commerce have be put to great inconvenience and expense by reason of the lowering of the water level of the great lakes this be an international problem on which competent engineer be make report out of their study it be expect that a feasible method will be develop for raise the level to provide relief for our commerce and supply water for drainage whenever a practical plan be present it ought to be speedily adopt reclamation it be increasingly evident that the federal government must in the future take a leading part in the impounding of water for conservation with incidental power for the development of the irrigable land of the and region the unused water of the west be find mainly in large river work to store and distribute these have such magnitude and cost that they be not attractive to private enterprise water be the irreplaceable natural resource its precipitation can not be increase its storage on the high reach of stream to meet grow need to be use repeatedly as it flow toward the sea be a practical and prudent business policy the united states promise to follow the course of old irrigation country where recent important irrigation development have be carry out as national undertaking it be gratify therefore that condition on federal reclamation project have become satisfactory the gross value of crop grow with water from project work increase from $ 110,000,000 in 1924 to $ 131,000,000 in 1925 the adjustment make last year by congress relieve irrigator from pay construction cost on unprofitable land and by so do inspire new hope and confidence in ability to meet the payment require construction payment by water user last year be the large in the history of the bureau the anticipated reclamation fund will be fully absorb for a number of year in the completion of old project and the construction of project inaugurate in the past three year we should however continue to investigate and study the possibility of a carefully plan development of promising project logically of governmental concern because of their physical magnitude immense cost and the interstate and international problem involve only in this way may we be fully prepared to meet intelligently the need of our fast grow population in the year to come transportation it would be difficult to conceive of any modern activity which contribute more to the necessity and convenience of life than transportation without it our present agricultural production and practically all of our commerce would be completely prostrate one of the large contributing cause to the present highly satisfactory state of our economic condition be the prompt and dependable service surpass all our previous record render by the railroad this power have be foster by the spirit of cooperation between federal and state regulatory commission to render this service more efficient and effective and to promote a more scientific regulation the process of value railroad property should be simplify and the primary valuation should be complete as rapidly as possible the problem of rate reduction would be much simplify by a process of railroad consolidation this principle have already be adopt as federal law experience have show that a more effective method must be provide study have already be make and legislation introduce seek to promote this end it would be of great advantage if it could be take up at once and speedily enact the railroad system of the country and the convenience of all the people be wait on this important decision merchant marine it be axiomatic that no agricultural and industrial country can get the full benefit of its own advantage without a merchant marine we have be proceed under the act of congress that contemplate the establishment of trade route to be ultimately transfer to private ownership and operation due to temporary condition abroad and at home we have a large demand just now for certain type of freight vessel some suggestion have be make for new construction i do not feel that we be yet warrant in enter that field such ship as we might build could not be sell after they be launch for anywhere near what they would cost we have expend over $ 250,000,000 out of the public treasury in recent year to make up the loss of operation not count the depreciation or any cost whatever of our capital investment the great need of our merchant marine be not for more ship but for more freight our merchant be altogether too indifferent about use american ship for the transportation of good which they send abroad or bring home some of our vessel necessarily need repair which should be make i do not believe that the operation of our fleet be as economical and efficient as it could be make if place under a single responsible head leave the shipping board free to deal with general matter of policy and regulation radio legislation the department of commerce have for some year urgently present the necessity for further legislation in order to protect radio listener from interference between broadcasting station and to carry out other regulatory function both branch of congress at the last session pass enactment intend to effect such regulation but the two bill yet remain to be bring into agreement and final passage due to decision of the court the authority of the department under the law of 1912 have break down many more station have be operate than can be accommodate within the limited number of wave length available further station be in course of construction many station have depart from the scheme of allocation set down by the department and the whole service of this most important public function have drift into such chaos as seem likely if not remedie to destroy its great value i most urgently recommend that this legislation should be speedily enact i do not believe it be desirable to set tip further independent agency in the government rather i believe it advisable to entrust the important function of decide who shall exercise the privilege of radio transmission and under what condition the assigning of wave length and determination of power to a board to be assemble whenever action on such question become necessary there should be right of appeal to the court from the decision of such board the administration of the decision of the board and the other feature of regulation and promotion of radio in the public interest together with scientific research should remain in the department of commerce such an arrangement make for more expert more efficient and more economical administration that an independent agency or board whose duty after initial stage require but little attention in which administrative function be confuse with semijudicial function and from which of necessity there must be greatly increase personnel and expenditure the wage earner the great body of our people be make up of wage earner several hundred thousand of they be on the pay roll of the united states government their condition very largely be fix by legislation we have recently provide increase in compensation under a method of reclassification and give they the advantage of a liberal retirement system as a support for their decline year most of they be under the merit system which be a guaranty oftheir intelligence and the efficiency of their service be a demonstration of their loyalty the federal government should continue to set a good example for all other employer in the industry the condition of the wage earner have steadily improve the 12 hour day be almost entirely unknown skilled labor be well compensate but there be unfortunately a multitude of worker who have not yet come to share in the general prosperity of the nation both the public authority and private enterprise should be solicitous to advance the welfare of this class the federal government have be seek to secure this end through a protective tariff through restrictive immigration through require safety device for the prevention of accident through the granting of workman 's compensation through civilian vocational rehabilitation and education through employment information bureau and through such humanitarian relief as be provide in the maternity and infancy legislation it be a satisfaction to report that a more general condition of contentment exist among wage earner and the country be more free from labor dispute than it have be for year while restrictive immigration have be adopt in part for the benefit of the wage earner and in its entirety for the benefit of the country it ought not to cause a needless separation of family and dependent from their natural source of support contrary to the dictate of humanity bituminous coal no progress appear to have be make within large area of the bituminous coal industry toward creation of voluntary machinery by which great assurance can be give to the public of peaceful adjustment of wage difficulty such as have be accomplish in the anthracite industry this bituminous industry be one of primary necessity and bear a great responsibility to the nation for continuity of supply as the wage agreement in the unionized section of the industry expire on april 1 next and as conflict may result which may imperil public interest and have for many year often call for action of the executive in protection of the public i again recommend the passage of such legislation as will assist the executive in deal with such emergency through a special temporary board of conciliation and mediation and through administrative agency for the purpose of distribution of coal and protection of the consumer of coal from profiteer at present the executive be not only without authority to act but be actually prohibit by law from make any expenditure to meet the emergency of a coal famine judiciary the federal court hold a high position in the administration of justice in the world while individual judicial officer have sometimes be subject to just criticism the court as a whole have maintain an exceedingly high standard the congress may well consider the question of supply fair salary and confer upon the supreme court the same rule make power on the law side of the district court that they have always possess on the equity side a bill be also pende provide for retirement after a certain number of year of service although they have not be consecutive which should have your favorable consideration these faithful servant of the government be about the last that remain to be provide for in the postwar readjustment banking there have be pende in congress for nearly three year banking legislation to clarify the national bank act and reasonably to increase the power of the national bank i believe that within the limitation of sound banking principle congress should now and for the future place the national bank upon a fair equality with their competitor the state bank and i trust that mean may be find so that the difference on branch banking legislation between the senate and the house of representatives may be settle along sound line and the legislation promptly enact it would be difficult to overestimate the service which the federal reserve system have already render to the country it be necessary only to recall the chaotic condition of our banking organization at the time the federal reserve system be put into operation the old system consist of a vast number of independent banking unit with scatter bank reserve which never could be mobilize in time of great need in spite of vast banking resource there be no coordination of reserve or any credit elasticity as a consequence a strain be feel even during crop move period and when it be necessary to meet other seasonal and regularly recur need the federal reserve system be not a panacea for all economic or financial ill it can not prevent depression in certain industry which be experience overexpansion of production or contraction of their market its business be to furnish adequate credit and currency facility this it have succeed in do both during the war and in the more difficult period of deflation and readjustment which follow it enable we to look to the future with confidence and to make plan far ahead base on the belief that the federal reserve system will exercise a steadying influence on credit condition and thereby prevent tiny sudden or severe reaction from the period of prosperity which we be now enjoy in order that these plan may go forward action should be take at the present session on the question of renew the bank charter and thereby insure a continuation of the policy and present usefulness of the federal reserve system federal regulation i be in favor of reduce rather than expand government bureaus which seek to regulate and control the business activity of the people everyone be aware that abuse exist and will exist so long as we be limit by human imperfection unfortunately human nature can not be change by an act of the legislature when practically the sole remedy for many evil lie in the necessity of the people look out for themselves and reform their own abuse they will find that they be rely on a false security if the government assume to hold out the promise that it be look out for they and provide reform for they this principle be preeminently applicable to the national government it be too much assume that because an abuse exist it be the business of the national government to provide a remedy the presumption should be that it be the business of local and state government such national action result in encroach upon the salutary independence of the states and by undertake to supersede their natural authority fill the land with bureaus and department which be undertake to do what it be impossible for they to accomplish and bring our whole system of government into disrespect and disfavor we ought to maintain high standard we ought to punish wrongdoing society have not only the privilege but the absolute duty of protect itself and its individual but we can not accomplish this end by adopt a wrong method permanent success lie in local rather than national action unless the locality rise to its own requirement there be an almost irresistible impulse for the national government to intervene the states and the nation should both realize that such action be to be adopt only as a last resort the negro the social well being of our country require our constant effort for the amelioration of race prejudice and the extension to all element of equal opportunity and equal protection under the law which be guarantee by the constitution the federal government especially be charge with this obligation in behalf of the colored people of the nation not only their remarkable progress their devotion and their loyalty but our duty to ourselves under our claim that we be an enlightened people require we to use all our power to protect they from the crime of lynch although violence of this kind have very much decrease while any of it remain we can not justify neglect to make every effort to eradicate it by law the education of the colored race under government encouragement be proceed successfully and ought to have continue support an increase need exist for properly educate and train medical skill to be devoted to the service of this race insular possession this government hold in sacred trusteeship island which it have acquire in the east and west indies in all of they the people be more prosperous than at any previous time a system of good road education and general development be in progress the people be well govern than ever before and generally content in the philippine islands maj gen. leonard wood have be governor general for five year and have administer his office with tact and ability greatly to the success of the filipino people these be a proud and sensitive race who be make such progress with our cooperation that we can view the result of this experiment with great satisfaction as we be attempt to assist this race toward self government we should look upon their wish with great respect grant their request immediately when they be right yet maintain a frank firmness in refuse when they be wrong we shall measure their progress in no small part by their acceptance of the term of the organic law under which the island be govern and their faithful observance of its provision need exist for clarify the duty of the auditor and declare they to be what everyone have suppose they be we have place our own expenditure under the supervision of the comptroller general it be not likely that the expenditure in the philippine islands need less supervision than our own the governor general be hamper in his selection of subordinate by the necessity of secure a confirmation which have oftentime drive he to the expediency of use army officer in work for which civilian expert would be much well fit mean should be provide for this and such other purpose as he may require out of the revenue which this government now turn back to the philippine treasury in order that these possession might stiffer no seem neglect i have recently send col carmi a thompson to the island to make a survey in cooperation with the governor general to suggest what might be do to improve condition later i may make a more extended report include recommendation the economic development of the island be very important they ought not to be turn back to the people until they be both politically fit for self government and economically independent large area be adaptable to the production of rubber no one contemplate any time in the future either under the present or a more independent form of government when we should not assume some responsibility for their defense for their economic advantage for the employment of their people and as a contribution to our power of defense which could not be carry on without rubber i believe this industry should be encourage it be especially adapt to the filipino people themselves who might cultivate it individually on a small acreage it could be carry on extensively by american capital in a way to furnish employment at good wage i be oppose to the promotion of any policy that do not provide for absolute freedom on the part of the wage earner and do not think we should undertake to give power for large holding of land in the island against the opposition of the people of the locality any development of the island must be solely with the first object of benefit the people of the island at an early day these possession should be take out from under all military control and administer entirely on the civil side of government national defense our policy of national defense be not one of make war but of insure peace the land and sea force of america both in its domestic and foreign implication be distinctly a peace force it be an arm of the police power to guarantee order and the execution of the law at home and security to our citizen abroad no self respect nation would neglect to provide an army and navy proportionate to its population the extent of its territory and the dignity of the place which it occupy in the world when it be consider that no navy in the world with one exception approach ours and none surpass it that our regular army of about 115,000 man be the equal of any other like number of troop that our entire permanent and reserve land and sea force train and training consist of a personnel of about 610,000 and that our annual appropriation be about $ 680,000,000 a year expend under the direction of an exceedingly competent staff it can not be say that our country be neglect its national defense it be true that a cult of disparagement exist but that candid examination make by the congress through its various committee have always reassure the country and demonstrate that it be maintain the most adequate defensive force in these present year that it have ever support in time of peace this general policy should be keep in effect here and there temporary change may be make in personnel to meet requirement in other direction attention should be give to submarine cruiser and air force particular point may need strengthening but as a whole our military power be sufficient the one weak place in the whole line be our still stupendous war debt in any modern campaign the dollar be the shock troop with a deplete treasury in the rear no army can maintain itself in the field a country load with debt be a country devoid of the first line of defense economy be the handmaid of preparedness if we wish to be able to defend ourselves to the full extent of our power in the future we shall discharge as soon as possible the financial burden of the last war otherwise we would face a crisis with a part of our capital resource already expend the amount and kind of our military equipment be preeminently a question for the decision of the congress after give due consideration to the advice of military expert and the available public revenue nothing be more laudable than the cooperation of the agricultural and industrial resource of the country for the purpose of supply the need of national defense in time of peril the people employ in these interest volunteer in a most self sacrifice way often at the nominal charge of a dollar a year but the army and navy be not support for the benefit of supply concern supply concern be support for the benefit of the army and navy the distribution of order on what be need from different concern for the purpose of keep up equipment and organization be perfectly justified but any attempt to prevail upon the government to purchase beyond its need ought not to be tolerate it be eminently fair that those who deal with the government should do so at a reasonable profit however public money be expend not that some one may profit by it but in order to serve a public purpose while our policy of national defense will proceed in order that we may be independent and self sufficient i be oppose to engage in any attempt at competitive armament no matter how much or how little some other country may feel constrain to provide we can well afford to set the example not of be dictate to by other but of adopt our own standard we be strong enough to pursue that method which will be a most wholesome model for the rest of the world we be eminently peaceful but we be by no means weak while we submit our difference with other not to the adjudication of force but of reason it be not because we be unable to defend our right while we be do our good to eliminate all resort to war for the purpose of settle dispute we can not but remember that the peace we now enjoy have to be win by the sword and that if the right of our country be to be defend we can not rely for that purpose upon anyone but ourselves we can not shirk the responsibility which be the first requisite of all government of preserve its own integrity and maintain the right of its own citizen it be only in accordance with these principle that we can establish any last foundation for an honorable and permanent peace it be for these reason that our country like any other country propose to provide itself with an army and navy support by a merchant marine yet these be not for competition with any other power for year we have beseech nation to disarm we have recently express our willingness at geneva to enter into treaty for the limitation of all type of warship accord to the ratio adopt at the washington conference this offer be still pende while we be and shall continue to be arm it be not as a menace but rather a common assurance of tranquility to all the peacelove people of the world for we to do any less would be to disregard our obligation evade our responsibility and jeopardize our national honor veterans this country not only because it be bind by honor but because of the satisfaction derive from it have always lavish its bounty upon its veteran for year a service pension have be bestow upon the grand army on reach a certain age like provision have be make for the survivor of the spanish war a liberal future compensation have be grant to all the veteran of the world war but it be in the case of the disabled and the dependent that the government exhibit its great solicitude this work be be well administer by the veterans bureau the main unfinished feature be that of hospitalization this requirement be be rapidly meet various veteran body will present to you recommendation which should have your careful consideration at the last session we increase our annual expenditure for pension and relief on account of the veteran of three war while i approve of proper relief for all suffering i do not favor any further extension of our pension system at this time alien property we still have in the possession of the government the alien property it have always be the policy of america to hold that private enemy property should not be confiscate in time of war this principle we have scrupulously observe as this property be security for the claim of our citizen and our government we can not relinquish it without adequate provision for their reimbursement legislation for the return of this property accompany by suitable provision for the liquidation of the claim of our citizen and our treasury should be adopt if our government release to foreigner the security which it hold for americans it must at the same time provide satisfactory safeguard for meet american claim prohibition the duly authorize public authority of this country have make prohibition the law of the land act under the constitution the congress and the legislature of practically all the states have adopt legislation for its enforcement some abuse have arise which require reform under the law the national government have entrust to the treasury department the especial duty of regulation and enforcement such supplementary legislation as it require to meet exist condition should be carefully and speedily enact failure to support the constitution and observe the law ought not to be tolerate by public opinion especially those in public place who have take their oath to support the constitution ought to be most scrupulous in its observance officer of the department of justice throughout the country should be vigilant in enforce the law but local authority which have always be mainly responsible for the enforcement of law in relation to intoxicate liquor ought not to seek evasion by attempt to shift the burden wholly upon the federal agency under the constitution the states be jointly charge with the nation in provide for the enforcement of the prohibition amendment some people do not like the amendment some do not like other part of the constitution some do not like any of it those who entertain such sentiment have a perfect right to seek through legal method for a change but for any of our inhabitant to observe such part of the constitution as they like while disregard other be a doctrine that would break down all protection of life and property and destroy the american system of order liberty foreign relation the foreign policy of this government be well know it be one of peace base on that mutual respect that arise from mutual regard for international right arid the discharge of international obligation it be our purpose to promote understanding and good will between ourselves and all other people the american people be altogether lack in an appreciation of the tremendous good fortune that surround their international position we have no traditional enemy we be not embarrassed over any dispute territory we have no possession that be covet by other they have none that be covet by we our border be

my fellow americans
 on the 22d day of february 1932 america will celebrate the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of george washington wherever there be those who love order liberty they may well join in the observance of that event although he belong to we yet by be a great american he become a great world figure it be but natural that here under the shadow of the stately monument use to his memory in the capital city bear his name the country make independent by his military genius and the republic establish by his statesmanship should already begin preparation to proclaim the immortal honor in which we hold the father of our country
 in recognition of the importance of this come anniversary more than two year ago the congress pass a joint resolution establish a commission which be direct to have this address make to the american people remind they of the reason and purpose for hold the come celebration it be also consider that now would be an appropriate time to inform the public that this commission desire to receive suggestion concern plan for the propose celebration and to express the hope that the states and their political subdivision under the direction of their governor and local authority would soon arrange for appoint commission and committee to formulate program for cooperation with the federal government when the plan begin to be mature they should embrace the active support of educational and religious institution of the many civic social and fraternal organization agricultural and trade association and of other numerous activity which characterize our national life
 it be greatly to be hope that out of the study pursue and the investigation make a more broad and comprehensive understanding and a more complete conception of washington the man and his relation to all that be characteristic of american life may be secure it be to be expect that he would be idealize by his countryman his live at a time when there be scantly report in the public press couple with the inclination of early biographer result in a rather imaginary character be create in response to the universal desire to worship his memory the fact of his life be of record but be not easily accessible while many excellent book often scholarly and eloquent have be write about he the temptation have be so wrong to represent he as an heroic figure compose of superlative that the real man among man the human being subject to the trial and temptation common to all mortal have be too much obscure and forget when we regard he in this character and have reveal to we the judgment with which he meet his problem we shall all the more understand and revere his true greatness no great mystery surround he he never rely on miracle but he be a man endow with what have be call uncommon common sense with tireless industry with a talent for take infinite pain and with a mind able to understand the universal and eternal problem of mankind
 washington have come to be know to the public almost exclusively as the virginia colonel who accompany the unfortunate expedition of general braddock as the commander in chief of the continental army during the revolutionary war as the first president of the united states and as the master of the beautiful estate at mount vernon this general estimate be base to a large extent on the command he hold in time of war and the public office he hold in time of peace a recital of his courage and patriotism his loyalty and devotion his self sacrifice his refusal to be will always arouse the imagination and aspire the soul of everyone who love his country nothing can detract from the exalt place which this record entitle he to old but he have an appeal even broad than this which to day be equally valuable to the people of the united states not many of our citizen be to be call on take high command or to hold high public office we be all necessarily engage in the ordinary affair of life as a valuable example to youth and to maturity the experience of washington in these direction be worthy of much more attention than it have receive
 we all share in the benefit which accrue from the independence he win and the free republic he do so much to establish we need a diligent comprehension and understanding of the great principle of government which he work out but we shall also secure a wide practical advantage if we go beyond this record already so eloquently expounded and consider he also as a man of affair it be in this field that he develop that executive ability which he later display in the camp and in the council chamber
 it ought always to be an inspiration to the young people of the country to know that from early youth washington show a disposition to make the most of his opportunity he be diligently industrious a most admirable and desirable if seemingly uninteresting trait his father who have be educate in england die when his son be 1 year old his mother have but moderate educational advantage there be no great incentive to learn in virginia in 1732 and the facility for acquire knowledge be still meager the boy might well have grow up with very little education but his eager mind and indomitable will lead he to acquire learning and information despite the handicap surround he

 when 16 he become a surveyor and for our year earn a living and much experience in that calling although considerable have be write about it not many people think of our first president as an agriculturist he prepare a treatise on this subject those who have study this phase of his life tell as he be probably the most successful owner and director of an agricultural estate in his day a visitor in 1785 declare washington&#39;s great pride be to be think the first farmer in america toward the end of his life he write
 i be lead to reflect how much more delightful to an undebauched mind be the task of make improvement on the earth than all the vain glory which can be acquire from ravage it by the most uninterrupted career of conquest
 he always have a great affection for mount vernon he increase his land holding from 2,500 to over 8,000 acre 3,200 of which he have under cultivation at one time
 his estate be manage in a thoroughly businesslike fashion he keep a very careful net of account book for it as he do for his other enterprise overseer make weekly statement show just how each laborer have be employ what crop have be plant or gather while he be absent report be send to he and he reply in long letter of instruction display wonderful familiarity with detail he be one of the first convert to the benefit of scientific fertilization and to the rotation of crop for that purpose make elaborate table cover five year period he overlook no detail in carry on his farm accord to the practice of those day produce on the premise most of the thing need there even to shoe and textile he begin the daily round of his field at sunrise and often remove his coat and help his man in the work of the day
 he also show his business ability by the skillful way in which he manage the considerable estate leave to his two stepchildren by their father so successfully be this do that john parke curtis become at the age of 21 the rich young man in the old dominion prussing tell we that martha custis be advise to get the able man in the colony to manage her estate and to pay he any salary within reason and he add that she choose wisely in marry the young colonel and get the good of a good bargain be the opinion of many
 he be engage in many business enterprise that of the dismal swamp comprise drainage and lumber operation south of norfolk be handle efficiently by washington for five year subsequent to 1763 in addition to his land holding wisely choose the rise in value of which account in no small degree for his fortune washington participate in a number of real estate and transportation company as a private citizen he be constantly on the outlook for sound investment and for way to increase his capital in the purchase of frontier land and in the promotion of plan for the building up and development of new part of the country he be perform important public service
 dr. albert bushnell hart distinguished historian and a member of our commission say
 washington have be criticize for buy up land warrant and hold on to his title in the face of squatter actually no american have ever do so much to open up vast tract of land first under the british and then under the american flag fit to become the home of million of american farmer
 after 13 year of effort washington force the british government to give to the virginia veteran of the french and indian war the 200,000 acre of western land promise by the governor of that colony his management and distribution of these bounty be carry out in an eminently efficient and satisfactory manner he acquire two large farm in maryland during a trip in new york state in 1783 he see the possibility of a waterway from the sea to the great lakes by way of the hudson river and the mohawk valley the present route of a great barge canal because of his business vision the join with general clinton in the purchase of 6,000 acre near utica
 to washington the man of affair we owe our national bank for have he follow the advice of other leader great but less enlighten on matter of finance the plan of alexander hamilton would not have be realize as a result of the war the country be deeply in debt and have no credit but the solution of our financial difficulty suggest by the first secretary of the treasury be oppose by those from rural community they argue that the large commercial city would dominate to the detriment of other part of the country both jefferson secretary of state and randolph attorney general in write oppose the incorporation by congress of a national bank they be join by madison and monroe all argue against the constitutionality of this proposition hamilton answer their argument fully in his famous opinion but have the president not be a man of affair have he not be for many year a large holder of stock in the bank of england come from the estate of daniel parke custis he might have yield to the opposition because he know something about bank account and bank credit the bill be sign and the foundation of our financial system lay
 washington be also a stockholder in the bank of alexandria and in the bank of columbia at georgetown in his last will and testament he direct that such money as should be derive from the sale of his estate during the lifetime of mrs. washington should be invest for she in good bank stock
 after his retirement from the presidency on march 1797 washington spend more than two and a half happy year at mount vernon in his last summer he make a will one of the most remarkable document of its kind of which we have record again he show his versatility in dispose of his many property under a variety of bequest and condition without legal advice it have be call an autobiographic will it show in its manifold provision his charitable thoughtfulness for his dependent and his solicitude for the future welfare of his country
 as president he be always an exponent of sound and honest public finance he advocate the payment of our debt in full to holder of record and the assumption by the nation of the debt incur by the various states to carry on the revolution his support of financial integrity because it be morally right strengthen the union
 the practical business ability and interest in broad and general affair make he one of the first to realize that the future of the american empire lie in the region beyond the alleghenies in the territory of the ohio and the mississippi because of this belief he be say to have be the move spirit in the first plan for the organization of our public land his association with the west may have start in the period 1749 1751 when he assist his brother lawrence in his various business enterprise among they the ohio company which have a grant of 500,000 acre of land on the east side of the ohio river the french having drive out the early british settler who have start a fort where pittsburgh now stand washington at the age of 21 volunteer to head an expedition for its recovery the comprehensive report of this young man be consider of enough importance to be send from london to all the european capital by way of justify great britain in make war upon france in 1763 he organize the mississippi company to take the place of the ohio company which be one of the casualty of the war he apply for a grant of 1,000,000 acre of land though he do not receive it but he make his own investment so that in the schedule of his property attach to his will we find western land appraise at over $ 400,000 along the ohio the great kanawha in western pennsylvania in kentucky and in the northwest territory
 have a vision of what the west mean in the future prosperity of the new republic washington in 1784 journey out into the wild his diary of the trip be fill with interest and enthusiasm over the possibility of that region hulbert who have make a study of it call he our first expansionist the originator of the idea of possess the west through commercial relation it be a pioneer idea instinct with genius this author write and washington&#39;s advocacy of it mark he as the first commercial american the first man typical of the american that be to be due to his investment he become the president of the james river company and of the potomac river company organize in 1785 to look into the possibility of open navigation through to the west to the potomac company which involve the first interstate commerce negotiation in this country he devote four year of service it have be think that these negotiation enter into by washington lead up almost directly to the calling of the constitutional convention they reveal clearly the difficulty under the articles of confederation of accomplish anything involve the welfare of all the states and show the need of a more strongly centralize national government his ability as a business man be the strong support of his statesmanship it make his political idea intensely practical
 washington&#39;s atlantic mississippi waterway plan be never carry out but his advocacy of it without doubt have much to do with prevent a break in the union which threaten serious consequence the people of western north carolina now tennessee shut off from the east by mountain have no outlet to the sea other than the mississippi and spain control the mouth of this river levy heavy tribute on all commerce pass through it disappoint at the inability of the national government to get concession from spain they in 1784 establish a separate state and start negotiation for an association with that foreign country this action be rescind after washington put forth his waterway plan
 that he should have be responsible in large measure for the opening of the west and for call attention to the commercial advantage the country might derive therefrom be by no mean the least of his benefaction to the nation he demonstrate that those who develop our resource whether along agricultural commercial and industrial line or in any field of endeavor be entitle to the approval rather than the censure of their countryman
 washington be a builder a creator he have a national mind he be constantly warn his countryman of the danger of settle problem in accordance with sectional interest his idea in regard to the opening of our western territory be think out primarily for the benefit of the nation it have be say that he would have be the great man in america have there be no revolutionary war
 he be largely instrumental in select the site for our national capital influence in no small degree by his vision of the commercial possibility of this locality it include his plan of the waterway to the west through the potomac the monongahela and the ohio rivers which he use to speak of as the channel of commerce to the extensive and valuable trade of a rise empire he of course could not foresee the development of railway transportation and the great ocean go vessel because of which the seat of our government became separate from active contact with commerce and be leave to develop as the cultural and intellectual center of the nation due to the genius of l&#39;enfant the great engineer this city from the first have have a magnificient plan of development its adoption be due in no small degree to the engineering foresight and executive ability of washington by 1932 we shall have make much progress toward perfect the ideal city plan by he in the closing day of the eighteenth century
 washington have the ability to translate ideal into the practical affair of life he be interested in what he believe contribute to the betterment of every day existence perhaps because he realize the deficiency of his own early education he be solicitous to provide liberal facility for the youth of the future because as a man of affair he know the every day use of learn in an early message to the congress and in his will he seek method for the establishment of a national university even in this farewell address we find this exportation
 promote then as an object of primary importance institution for the general diffusion of knowledge in proportion as the structure of a government give force to public opinion it be essential that public opinion should be enlighten
 he desire his system of education to be thoroughly american and thoroughly national it be to support the people in a knowledge of their right in the creation of a republican spirit and in the maintenance of the union
 it be with the same clear vision that he look upon religion for he there be little in it of emotionalism he place it on a firm more secure foundation and state the benefit which would accrue to his country as the result of faith in spiritual thing he recognize that religion be the main support of free institution in his farewell address he say
 of all the disposition and habit which lead to political prosperity religion and morality be indispensable support in vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillar of human happiness these firm prop of the duty of man and citizen the mere politician equally with the pious man ought to respect and to cherish they a volume could not trace all their connection with private and public felicity let it simply be ask where be the security for property for reputation for life if the sense of religious obligation desert the oath which be the instrument of investigation in court of justice and let we with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintain without religion
 whatever may be concede to the influence of refined education on mind of peculiar structure reason and experience both forbid we to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle it be substantially true that virtue or morality be a necessary spring of popular government the rule indeed extend with more or less force to every specie of free government who that be a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempt to shake the foundation of the fabric
 without bigotry without intolerance he appeal to the high spiritual nature of mankind his genius have fill the earth he have be recognize abroad as the great man of our own or any age he love his fellow man he love his country that he intrust their keeping to a divine province be reveal in the following prayer which he make in 1794
 let we unite in implore the supreme ruler of nation to spread his holy protection over these united states to turn the machination of the wicked to the confirming of our constitution to enable we at all time to root out internal sedition and put invasion to flight to perpetuate to our country that prosperity which his goodness have already confer and to verify the anticipation of this government be a safeguard of human right
 he be an idealist in the sense that he have a very high standard of private and public honor he be a prophet to the extent of be able to forecast with remarkable vision the growth of the nation he found and the change condition which it would meet but essentially he be a very practical man he analyze the problem before he with a clear intellect have a thorough understanding he attack they with courage and energy with patience and persistence he bring thing to pass when patrick henry be ask in 1774 whom he think be the great man in the continental congress he reply
 if you speak of eloquence mr. rutledge of south carolina be by far the great orator but if you speak of solid information and sound judgment colonel washington be unquestionably the great man on that floor
 his accomplishment be great because of an efficiency which mark his every act and a sublime compelling faith in the ultimate triumph of the right as we study his daily life as we read his letter his diary his paper we come to realize more and more his wisdom his energy and his efficiency he have the moral efficiency of an abide religious faith emphasize the importance of spiritual side of man the social efficiency show by his interest in his fellow man and in his realization of the inherent strength of a people unite by a sense of equality and freedom the business efficiency of a man of affair of the owner and manager of large property the governmental efficiency of the head of a new nation who take an untried political system make it operate successfully of a leader able to adapt the relation of the government to the people he understand how to translate political theory into a workable scheme of government he know that we can accomplish no permanent good by go to extreme the law of reason must always be apply he follow milton who declare law in a free nation hath ever be public reason and he agree with burke that man have no right to what be not reasonable
 it be a mark of a great man that he surround himself by great man washington place in the most important position in his cabinet jefferson with his advocacy of the utmost degree of local self government and of states&rsquo right and hamilton whose theory of a strong national government lead he to advocate the appointment of state governor by the president either theory carry to the extreme soon would have bring disaster to what have prove the most successful experiment in liberty under proper governmental restraint in the history of the world
 it be due to his memory that we guard the sovereign right of the individual state under our constitution with the same solicitude that we maintain the authority of the federal government in all matter vital to our continued national existence
 such be the background of a man perform the ordinary duty of life as it be george washington of course he perform they extraordinarily well the principle which he adopt in his early youth and maintain throughout his year be the source of all true greatness unless we understand this side of he we shall fail in our comprehension of his true character it be because of this training that he be able to assume the leadership of an almost impossible cause carry it on through a long period of discouragement and defeat and bring it to a successful conclusion in advance of all other he see that war be come with an army that be never large and constantly shift poorly support by a confederation inexperience inefficient and lack in almost all the essential element of a government he be victorious over the army of seasoned troop command by howe burgoyne clinton and cornwallis support by one of the most stable and solid of government possess of enormous revenue and ample credit represent the first military power of the world
 as an example of generalship extend over a series of year from the siege of boston to the fall of yorktown the commander in chief of the continental armies hold a position that be unrivale in the history of warfare he never waver he never falter from the day he modestly undertake the tremendous task of lead a revolution to the day when with equal modesty he surrender his commission to the representative of the independent colonies he triumph over a people in the height of their glory who have acknowledge no victor for 700 year
 washington have come to personify the american republic he preside over the convention that frame our constitution the weight of his great name be the decide factor in secure its adoption by the states these result could never have be secure have it not be recognize that he would be the first president when we realize what it mean to take 13 distracted colony impoverished envious and hostile and weld they into an orderly federation under the authority of a central government we can form some estimate of the influence of this great man but when we go far and remember that the government which he do so much to bring into be not only do not falter when he retire from its administration but withstand every assault have constantly grow strong with the passage of time and be find adequate to meet the need of nearly 120,000,000 people occupy half a continent and constitute the great power the world have ever know we can judge something of the breadth and soundness of his statesmanship
 we have see many soldier who have leave behind they little but the memory of their conflict but among all the victor the power to establish among a great people a form of self government which the test of experience have show will endure be bestow upon washington and washington alone many other have be able to destroy he be able to construct that he have around he many great mind do not detract from his glory his be the direct spirit without which there would have be no independence no union no constitution and no republic his way be the way of truth he build for eternity his influence grow his stature increase with the increase year in wisdom of action in purity of character he stand alone we can not yet estimate he we can only indicate our reverence for he and thank the divine providence which send he to serve and inspire his fellow man

we have come here to dedicate a cornerstone that be lay by the hand of the almighty on this tower wall of rushmore in the heart of the black hills be to be inscribe a memorial which will represent some of the outstanding feature of four of our president lay on by the hand of a great artist in sculpture this memorial will crown the height of land between the rocky mountains and the atlantic seaboard where come generation may view it for all time

 it be but natural that such a design should begin with george washington for with he begin that which be truly characteristic of america he represent our independence our constitution our liberty he form the high aspiration that be entertain by any people into the permanent institution of our government he stand as the foremost disciple of order liberty a statesman with an inspire vision who be not outrank by any mortal greatness

 next to he will come thomas jefferson whose wisdom insure that the government which washington have form should be entrust to the administration of the people he emphasize the element of self government which have be enshrine in american institution in such a way as to demonstrate that it be practical and would be permanent in he be likewise embody the spirit of expansion recognize the destiny of this country he add to its territory by remove the possibility of any powerful opposition from a neighboring state he give new guaranty to the rule of the people

 after our country have be establish enlarge from sea to sea and be dedicate to popular government the next great task be to demonstrate the permanency of our union and to extend the principle of freedom to all inhabitant of our land the master of this supreme accomplishment be abraham lincoln above all other national figure he hold the love of his fellow countryman the work which washington and jefferson begin he extend to its logical conclusion

 that the principle for which these three man stand might be still more firmly establish destiny raise up theodore roosevelt to political freedom he strive to add economic freedom by build the panama canal he bring into close relationship the east and the west and realize the vision that inspire columbus in his search for a new passage to the orient

 the union of these four president carve on the face of the everlasting hill of south dakota will constitute a distinctly national monument it will be decidedly american in conception in its magnitude in its meaning and altogether worthy of our country no one can look upon it understandingly without realize that it be a picture of hope fulfil its location will be significant here in the heart of the continent on the side of a mountain which probably no white man have ever beheld in the day of washington in territory which be acquire by the action of jefferson which remain an unbroken wilderness beyond the day of lincoln which be especially belove by roosevelt the people of the future will see history and art combine to portray the spirit of patriotism they will know that the figure of these president have be place here because by follow the truth they build for eternity the fundamental principle which they represent have be work into the very being of our country they be steadfast as these ancient hill

 other people have marvel at the growth and strength of america they have wonder how a few weak and discordant colony be able to win their independence from one of the great power of the world they have be amazed at our genius for self government they have be unable to comprehend how the shock of a great civil war do not destroy our union they do not understand the economic progress of our people it be true that we have have the advantage of great natural resource but those have not be exclusively ours other have be equally fortunate in that direction the progress of america have be due to the spirit of the people it be in no small degree due to that spirit that we have be able to produce such great leader if coming generation be to maintain a like spirit it will be because they continue to support the principle which these man represent it be for that purpose that we erect memorial we can not hold our admiration for the historic figure which we shall see here without grow strong in our determination to perpetuate the institution which their life reveal and establish

 the fact that this enterprise be be begin in one of our new state not yet great in population not largely develop in its resource disclose that the old american spirit still go where our people go still dominate their life still inspire they to deed of devotion and sacrifice it be but another illustration of the determination of our people to use their material resource to minister to their spiritual life this memorial will be another national shrine to which future generation will repair to declare their continue allegiance to independence to self government to freedom and to economic justice it be an inspiring phase of american life that man be willing to devote their energy to the erection of a memorial of this nature money spend for such a purpose be certain of adequate return in the nature of increase public welfare

 the people of south dakota be take the lead in the preparation of this memorial out of their meager resource because the american spirit be strong among they their effort and courage entitle they to the sympathy and support of private beneficence and the national government they realize fully that they have no mean of succeed in the development of their state except a strong reliance upon american institution they do not fail to appreciate their value there be no power that can stay the progress of such a people they be predestine to success our country be fortunate in have the advantage of their citizenship they have be pioneer in the development of their state they will continue to be pioneer in the defense and development of american institution
member of the congress it be gratify to report that for the fourth consecutive year the state of the union in general be good we be at peace the country as a whole have have a prosperity never exceed wage be at their high range employment be plentiful some part of agriculture and industry have lag some locality have suffer from storm and flood but such loss have be absorb without serious detriment

capital for new construction in industry and public work the purchasing power of agriculture have increase if the people maintain that confidence which they be entitle to have in themselves in each other and in america a comfortable prosperity will continue constructive economy without constructive economy in government expenditure we should not now be enjoy these result or these prospect because we be not now physically at war some people be disposed to forget that our war debt still remain the nation must make financial sacrifice accompany by a stern self denial in public expenditure until we have conquer the disability of our public finance while our obligation to veteran and dependent be large and continuing the heavy burden of the national debt be be steadily eliminate at the end of this fiscal year it will be reduce from about $ 26,600,000,000 to about $ 17,975,000,000 annual interest include war saving will have be reduce from $ 1,055,000,000 to $ 670,0001,000 the sacrifice of the people the economy of the government be show remarkable result they should be continue for the purpose of relieve the nation of the burden of interest and debt and release revenue for internal improvement and national development not only the amount but the rate of government interest have be reduce callable bond have be refund and pay so that during this year the average rate of interest on the present public debt for the first time fall below 4 per cent keep the credit of the nation high be a tremendously profitable operation tax reduction the immediate fruit of economy and the retirement of the public debt be tax reduction the annual saving in interest between 1925 and 1929 be $ 212,000,000 without this no bill to relieve the taxpayer would be worth propose the three measure already enact leave our government revenue where they be not oppressive exemption have be increase until 115,000,000 people make but 2,500,000 individual taxable return so that further reduction should be mainly for the purpose of remove inequality the secretary of the treasury have recommend a measure which would give we a much well balanced system of taxation and without oppression produce sufficient revenue it have my complete support unforeseen contingency require money be always arise our probable surplus for june 30 1929 be small a slight depression in business would greatly reduce our revenue because of our present method of taxation the people ought to take no selfish attitude of press for remove moderate and fair taxis which might produce a deficit we must keep our budget balance for each year that be the corner stone of our national credit the trifling price we pay to command the low rate of interest of any great power in the world any surplus can be apply to debt reduction and debt reduction be tax reduction under the present circumstance it would be far well to leave the rate as they be than to enact a bill carry the peril of a deficit this be not a problem to be approach in a narrow or partisan spirit all of those who participate in find a reasonable solution will be entitle to participate in any credit that accrue from it without regard to party the congress have already demonstrate that tax legislation can be remove from purely political consideration into the realm of patriotic business principle any bill for tax reduction should be write by those who be responsible for raising managing and expend the finance of the government if special interest too often selfish always uninformed of the national need as a whole with hire agent use their propose beneficiary as engine of propaganda be permit to influence the withdrawal of their property from taxation we shall have a law that be unbalanced and unjust bad for business bad for the country probably result in a deficit with disastrous financial consequence the constitution have give the members of the congress sole authority to decide what tax measure shall be present for approval while welcome information from any quarter the congress should continue to exercise its own judgment in a matter so vital and important to all the interest of the country as taxation national defense be a nation rely not on force but on fair dealing and good will to maintain peace with other we have provide a moderate military force in a form adapt solely to defense it should be continue with a very generous supply of officer and with the present base of personnel subject to fluctuation which may be temporarily desirable the five year program for our air force be in keep with this same policy and commensurate with the notable contribution of america to the science of aeronautic the provision of the law lately enact be be execute as fast as the practical difficulty of an orderly and stable development permit while our army be small prudence require that it should be keep in a high state of efficiency and provide with such supply as would permit of its immediate expansion the garrison ration have lately be increase recommendation for an appropriation of $ 6,166,000 for new housing make to the previous congress fail to pass while most of the army be well house some of it which be quarter in wartime training camp be becoming poorly house in the past three year $ 12,533,000 have be appropriate for reconstruction and repair and an authorization have be approve of $ 22,301,000 for new housing under which $ 8,070,000 have already be appropriate a law have also be pass comply with the request of the war department allocate fund receive from the sale of building and land for housing purpose the work however be not complete so that other appropriation be be recommend our navy be likewise a weapon of defense we have a foreign commerce and ocean line of trade unsurpasse by any other country we have outlying territory in the two great ocean and long stretch of seacoast stud with the rich city in the world we be responsible for the protection of a large population and the great treasure ever bestow upon any people we be charge with an international duty of defend the panama canal to meet these responsibility we need a very substantial sea armament it need aircraft development which be be provide under the five year program it need submarine as soon as the department decide upon the good type of construction it need airplane carrier and a material addition to its force of cruiser we can plan for the future and begin a moderate building program this country have put away the old world policy of competitive armament it can never be relieve of the responsibility of adequate national defense we have one treaty secure by an unprecedented attitude of generosity on our part for a limitation in naval armament after most careful preparation extend over month we recently make every effort to secure a three power treaty to the same end we be grant much cooperation by japan but we be unable to come to an agreement with great britain while the result of the conference be of considerable value they be mostly of a negative character we know now that no agreement can be reach which will be inconsistent with a considerable building program on our part we be ready and willing to continue the preparatory investigation on the general subject of limitation of armament which have be start under the auspex of the league of nations we have a considerable cruiser tonnage but a part of it be obsolete everyone know that have a three power agreement be reach it would have leave we with the necessity of continue our building program the failure to agree should not cause we to build either more or less than we otherwise should any future treaty of limitation will call on we for more ship we should enter on no competition we should refrain from no needful program it should be make clear to all the world that lack a definite agreement the attitude of any other country be not to be permit to alter our own policy it should especially be demonstrate that propaganda will not cause we to change our course where there be no treaty limitation the size of the navy which america be to have will be solely for america to determine no outside influence should enlarge it or diminish it but it should be know to all that our military power hold no threat of aggrandizement it be a guaranty of peace and security at home and when it go abroad it be an instrument for the protection of the legal right of our citizen under international law a refuge in time of disorder and always the servant of world peace wherever our flag go the right of humanity increase merchant marine the united states government fleet be transport a large amount of freight and reduce its drain on the treasury the shipping board be constantly under pressure to which it too often yield to protect private interest rather than serve the public welfare more attention should be give to merchant ship as an auxiliary of the navy the possibility of include their master and crew in the naval reserve with some reasonable compensation should be thoroughly explore as a method of encourage private operation of shipping public operation be not a success no investigation of which i have cause several to be make have fail to report that it could not succeed or to recommend speedy transfer to private ownership our exporter and importer be both indifferent about use american ship it should be our policy to keep our present vessel in repair and dispose of they as rapidly as possible rather than undertake any new construction their operation be a burden on the national treasury for which we be not receive sufficient benefit commercial aviation a rapid growth be take place in aeronautic the department of commerce have charge of the inspection and licensing system and the construction of national airway almost 8,000 mile be already complete and about 4,000 mile more contemplated nearly 4,400 mile be now equipped and over 3,000 mile more will have lighting and emergency landing field by next july air mail contract be expect to cover 24 of these line daily airway flying be nearly 15,000 mile and be expect to reach 25,000 mile early next year flight for other purpose exceed 22,000 mile each day over 900 airport complete and uncompleted have be lay out the demand for aircraft have greatly increase the policy already adopt by the congress be produce the sound development of this come industry western hemisphere air mail private enterprise be show much interest in open up aviation service to mexico and central and south america we be particularly solicitous to have the united states take a leading part in this development it be understand that the government of our sister country would be willing to cooperate their physical feature the undeveloped state of their transportation make an air service especially adaptable to their usage the post office department should be grant power to make liberal long term contract for carry our mail and authority should be give to the army and the navy to detail aviator and plane to cooperate with private enterprise in establish such mail service with the consent of the country concern a committee of the cabinet will later present a report on this subject good roads the importance and benefit of good road be more and more come to be appreciate the national government have be make liberal contribution to encourage their construction the result and benefit have be very gratifying national participation however should be confine to trunk line system the national tax on automobile be now nearly sufficient to meet this outlay this tax be very small and on low price car be not more than $ 2 or $ 3 each year while the advantage of have good road be very large the desire for improved highway be not limit to our own country it should and do include all the western hemisphere the principal point in canada be already accessible we ought to lend our encouragement in any way we can for more good road to all the principal point in this hemisphere south of the rio grande it have be our practice to supply these country with military and naval adviser when they have request it to assist they in national defense the art of peace be even more important to they and to we authority should be give by law to provide they at their request with engineering adviser for the construction of road and bridge in some of these country already wonderful progress be be make in road building but the engineering feature be often very exacting and the financing difficult private interest should look with favor on all reasonable loan seek by these country to open such main line of travel this general subject have be promote by the pan american congress of highways which will convene again at rio de janeiro in july 1928 it be desirable that the congress should provide for the appointment of delegate to represent the government of the united states cuban parcel post we have a temporary parcel post convention with cuba the advantage of it be all on our side during 1926 we ship twelve time as many parcel weigh twenty four time as much as we receive this convention be make on the understanding that we would repeal an old law prohibit the importation of cigar and cigarette in quantity less than 3,000 enact in 1866 to discourage smuggling for which it have long be unnecessary this law unjustly discriminate against an important industry of cuba its repeal have be recommend by the treasury and post office departments unless this be do our merchant and railroad will find themselves deprive of this large parcel post business after the 1st of next march the date of the expiration of the convention which have be extend upon the specific understanding that it would expire at that time unless this legislation be enact we purchase large quantity of tobacco make in cuba it be not probable that our purchase would be any large if this law be repeal while it would be an advantage to many other industry in the united states insular possession conditions in the philippine islands have be steadily improve contentment and good order prevail road irrigation work harbor improvement and public building be be construct public education and sanitation have be advance the government be in a sound financial condition these immediate result be especially due to the administration of gov. gen. leonard wood the six year of his governorship mark a distinct improvement in the island and rank as one of the outstanding accomplishment of this distinguished man his death be a loss to the nation and the island great progress could be make more efficiency could be put into administration if the congress would undertake to expend through its appropriating power all or a part of the custom revenue which be now turn over to the philippine treasury the power of the auditor of the island also need revision and clarification the government of the island be about 98 per cent in the hand of the filipinos an extension of the policy of self government will be hasten by the demonstration on their part of their desire and their ability to carry out cordially and efficiently the provision of the organic law enact by the congress for the government of the island it would be well for a committee of the congress to visit the island every two year a fair degree of progress be be make in porto rico its agricultural product be increase its treasury position which have give much concern show improvement i be advise by the governor that educational facility be still lack road be be construct which he represent be the first requisite for building schoolhouse the loyalty of the island to the united states be exceedingly gratifying a memorial will be present to you request authority to have the governor elect by the people of porto rico this be never do in the case of our own territories it be admit that education outside of the town be as yet very deficient until it have progress far the efficiency of the government and the happiness of the people may need the guide hand of an appoint governor as it be not contemplate that any change should be make immediately the general subject may well have the thoughtful study of the congress panama canal the number of commercial ship pass through the panama canal have increase from 3,967 in 1923 to 5,475 in 1927 the total amount of toll turn into the treasury be over $ 166,000,000 while all the operation of the canal have yield a surplus of about $ 80,000,000 in order to provide additional storage of water and give some control over the flood of the chagres river it be propose to erect a dam to cost about $ 12,000,000 at alhajuela it will take some five year to complete this work agriculture the past year have see a marked improvement in the general condition of agriculture production be well balanced and without acute shortage or heavy surplus cost have be reduce and the average output of the worker increase the level of farm price have rise while other have fall so that the purchase power of the farmer be approach a normal figure the individual farmer be entitle to great credit for the progress make since 1921 he have adjust his production and through cooperative organization and other method improve his marketing he be use authenticated fact and employ sound method which other industry be oblige to use to secure stability and prosperity the old fashioned haphazard system be be abandon economic be be apply to ascertain the well adapt unit of land diversification be be promote and scientific method be be use in production and business principle in marketing agriculture have not fully recover from postwar depression the fact be that economic progress never march forward in a straight line it go in wave one part go ahead while another halt and another recede everybody wish agriculture to prosper any sound and workable proposal to help the farmer will have the earnest support of the government their interest be not all identical legislation should assist as many producer in as many region as possible it should be the aim to assist the farmer to work out his own salvation socially and economically no plan will be of any permanent value to he which do not leave he stand on his own foundation in the past the government have spend vast sum to bring land under cultivation lt be apparent that this have reach temporarily the saturation point we have have a surplus of production and a poor market for land which have only lately show sign of improvement the main problem which be present for solution be one of deal with a surplus of production it be useless to propose a temporary expedient what be need be permanency and stability government price fixing be know to be unsound and bind to result in disaster a government subsidy would work out in the same way it can not be sound for all of the people to hire some of the people to produce a crop which neither the producer nor the rest of the people want price fixing and subsidy will both increase the surplus instead of diminish it put the government directly into business be merely a combination of subsidy and price fixing aggravate by political pressure these expedient would lead logically to tell the farmer by law what and how much he should plant and where he should plant it and what and how much he should sell and where he should sell it the most effective mean of deal with surplus crop be to reduce the surplus acreage while this can not be do by the individual farmer it can be do through the organization already in existence through the information publish by the department of agriculture and especially through bank and other who supply credit refuse to finance an acreage manifestly too large it be impossible to provide by law for an assured success and prosperity for all those who engage in farming if acreage becomes overextend the government can not assume responsibility for it the government can however assist cooperative association and other organization in orderly marketing and handle a surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal condition in order to save the producer from preventable loss while it be probably impossible to secure this result at a single step and much will have to be work out by trial and rejection a beginning could be make by set up a federal board or commission of able and experienced man in marketing grant equal advantage under this board to the various agricultural commodity and section of the country give encouragement to the cooperative movement in agriculture and provide a revolve loan fund at a moderate rate of interest for the necessary financing such legislation would lay the foundation for a permanent solution of the surplus problem this be not a proposal to lend more money to the farmer who be already fairly well finance but to lend money temporarily to experimental marketing association which will no doubt ultimately be finance by the regularly establish bank as be the temporary operation of the war finance corporation cooperative marketing especially would be provide with mean of buy or build physical property the national government have almost entirely relieve the farmer from income taxis by successive tax reduction but state and local taxis have increase put on he a grievous burden a policy of rigid economy should be apply to state and local expenditure this be clearly within the legislative domain of the states the federal government have also improve our banking structure and system of agricultural credit the farmer will be greatly benefit by similar action in many states the department of agriculture be undergo change in organization in order more completely to separate the research and regulatory division that each may be well administer more emphasis be be place on the research program not only by enlarge the appropriation for state experiment station but by provide fund for expand the research work of the department it be in this direction that much future progress can be expect the protective tariff the present tariff rate supply the national treasury with well over $ 600,000,000 of annual revenue yet about 65 per cent of our import come in duty free of the remain 35 per cent of import on which duty be lay about 23 per cent consist of luxury and agricultural product and the balance of about 12 per cent amount to around $ 560,000,000 be make up of manufacture and merchandise as no one be advocate any material reduction in the rate on agriculture or luxury it be only the comparatively small amount of about $ 560,000,000 of other import that be really consider in any discussion of reduce tariff rate while this amount duty free would be large enough seriously to depress many line of business in our own country it be of small importance when spread over the rest of the world it be often state that a reduction of tariff rate on industry would benefit agriculture it would be interesting to know to what commodity it be think this could be apply everything the farmer use in farming be already on the free list nearly everything he sell be protect it would seem to be obvious that it be well for tile country to have the farmer raise food to supply the domestic manufacturer than the foreign manufacturer in one case our country would have only the farmer in the other it would have the farmer and the manufacturer assume that europe would have more money if it sell we large amount of merchandise it be not certain it would consume more food or if it do that its purchase would be make in this country undoubtedly it would resort to the cheap market which be by no mean ours the large and good and most profitable market for the farmer in the world be our own domestic market any great increase in manufacture import mean the closing of our own plant nothing would be bad for agriculture probably no one expect a material reduction in the rate on manufacture while maintain the rate on agriculture a material reduction in either would be disastrous to tile farmer it would mean a general shrinkage of value a deflation of price a reduction of wage a general depression carry our people down to the low standard of living in our compete country it be obvious that this would not improve but destroy our market for import which be well serve by maintain our present high purchasing power under which in the past five year import have increase 63 per cent farm loan system it be exceedingly important that the federal land and joint stock land bank should furnish the good possible service for agriculture certain joint stock bank have fall into improper and unsound practice result in the indictment of the official of three of they more money have be provide for examination and at the instance of the treasury rule and regulation of the federal farm board have be revise early last may three of its member resign their place be fill with man connect with the war finance corporation eugene meyer be designate as farm loan commissioner the new member have demonstrate their ability in the field of agricultural finance in the extensive operation of he war finance corporation three joint stock bank have go into receivership it be necessary to preserve the public confidence in this system in order to find a market for their bond a recent flotation be make at a record low rate of 4 per cent careful supervision be absolutely necessary to protect the investor and enable these bank to exercise their chief function in serve agriculture muscle shoals the last year have see considerable change in the problem of muscle shoals development of other method show that nitrate can probably be produce at less cost than by the use of hydroelectric power extensive investigation make by the department of war indicate that the nitrate plant on this project be of little value for national defense and can probably be dispose of within two year the oxidation part of the plant however should be retain indefinitely this leave this project mostly concern with power it should nevertheless continue to be dedicate to agriculture it be probable that this desire can be well serve by dispose of the plant and apply the revenue receive from it to research for method of more economical production of concentrated fertilizer and to demonstration and other method of stimulate its use on the farm but in dispose of the property preference should be give to proposal to use all or part of it for nitrate production and fertilizer manufacturing flood control for many year the federal government have be build a system of dike along the mississippi river for protection against high water during the past season the low states be overcome by a most disastrous flood many thousand of square mile be inundate a great many life be lose much livestock be drown and a very heavy destruction of property be inflict upon the inhabitant the american red cross at once go to the relief of the stricken community appeal for contribution have bring in over $ 17,000,000 the federal government have provide service equipment and supply probably amount to about $ 7,000,000 more between $ 5,000,000 and $ 10,000,000 in addition have be provide by local railroad the states and their political unit credit have be arrange by the farm loan board and three emergency finance corporation with a total capital of $ 3,000,000 have insure additional resource to the extent of $ 12,000,000 through these mean the 700,000 people in the flooded area have be adequately support provision have be make to care for those in need until after the 1st of january the engineering corps of the army have contract to close all break in the dike system before the next season of high water a most thorough and elaborate survey of the whole situation have be make and embody in a report with recommendation for future flood control which will be present to the congress the carrying out of their plan will necessarily extend over a series of year they will call for a raising and strengthening of the dike system with provision for emergency spillway 's and improvement for the benefit of navigation under the present law the land adjacent to the dike have pay one third of the cost of their construction this have be a most extraordinary concession from the plan adopt in relation to irrigation where the general rule have be that the land benefit should bear the entire expense it be true of course that the troublesome water do not originate on the land to be reclaim but it be also true that such water have a right of way through that section of the country and the land there be charge with that easement it be the land of this region that be to be benefit to say that it be unable to bear any expense of reclamation be the same thing as say that it be not worth reclaim because of expense incur and charge already hold against this land it seem probable that some revision will have to be make concern the proportion of cost which it should bear but it be extremely important that it should pay enough so that those request improvement will be charge with some responsibility for their cost and the neighborhood where work be construct have a pecuniary interest in prevent waste and extravagance and secure a wise and economical expenditure of public fund it be necessary to look upon this emergency as a national disaster it have be so treat from its inception our whole people have provide with great generosity for its relief most of the department of the federal government have be engage in the same effort the government of the afflict area both state and municipal can not be give too high praise for the courageous and helpful way in which they have come to the rescue of the people if the source directly chargeable can not meet the demand the national government should not fail to provide generous relief this however do not mean restoration the government be not an insurer of its citizen against the hazard of the element we shall always have flood and drought heat and cold earthquake and wind lightning and tidal wave which be all too constant in their affliction the government do not undertake to reimburse its citizen for loss and damage incur under such circumstance it be chargeable however with the rebuilding of public work and the humanitarian duty of relieve its citizen from distress the people in the flooded area and their representative have approach this problem in the most generous and broad minded way they should be meet with a like spirit on the part of the national government this be all one country the public need of each part must be provide for by the public at large no required relief should be refuse an adequate plan should be adopt to prevent a recurrence of this disaster in order that the people may restore to productivity and comfort their field and their town legislation by this congress should be confine to our principal and most pressing problem the low mississippi consider tributary only so far as they materially affect the main flood problem a definite federal program relate to our waterway be propose when the last congress authorize a comprehensive survey of all the important stream of the country in order to provide for their improvement include flood control navigation power and irrigation other legislation should wait pende a report on this survey the recognize need of the mississippi should not be make a vehicle for carry other project all proposal for development should stand on their own merit any other method would result in ill advise conclusion great waste of money and instead of promote would delay the orderly and certain utilization of our water resource very recently several of the new england states have suffer somewhat similarly from heavy rainfall and high water no reliable estimate of damage have yet be compute but it be very large to private and public property the red cross be generously undertake what be need for immediate relief repair and reconstruction of house restock of domestic animal and food clothing and shelter a considerable sum of money will be available through the regular channel in the department of agriculture for reconstruction of highway it may be necessary to grant special aid for this purpose complete report of what be require will undoubtedly be available early in the session inland navigation the congress in its last session authorize the general improvement necessary to provide the mississippi waterway system with well transportation stabilization of the level of the great lakes and their opening to the sea by an effective shipway remain to be consider since the last session the board of engineers of the war department have make a report on the proposal for a canal through the state of new york and the joint board of engineers represent canada and the united states have finish a report on the st. lawrence river both of these board conclude that the st. lawrence project be cheap afford a more expeditious method of place western product in european market and will cost less to operate the state department have request the canadian government to negotiate treaty necessary to provide for this improvement it will also be necessary to secure an agreement with canada to put in work necessary to prevent fluctuation in the level of the great lakes legislation be desirable for the construction of a dam at boulder canyon on the colorado river primarily as a method of flood control and irrigation a secondary result would be a considerable power development and a source of domestic water supply for southern california flood control be clearly a national problem and water supply be a government problem but every other possibility should be exhaust before the federal government become engage in the power business the state which be interested ought to reach mutual agreement this project be in reality their work if they wish the federal government to undertake it they should not hesitate to make the necessary concession to each other this subject be fully discuss in the annual report of the secretary of the interior the columbia river basin project be be study and will be one to be consider at some future time the inland waterways corporation be prove successful and especially beneficial to agriculture a survey be be make to determine its future need it have never be contemplate that if inland river be open to navigation it would then be necessary for the federal government to provide the navigation such a request be very nearly the equivalent of a declaration that their navigation be not profitable that the commodity which they be to carry can be take at a cheap rate by some other method in which case the hundred of million of dollar propose to be expend for open river to navigation would be not only waste but would entail further constant expenditure to carry the commodity of private person for less than cost the policy be well establish that the government should open public highway on land and on water but for use of the public in their private capacity it have put on some demonstration barge line but always with the expectation that if they prove profitable they would pass into private hand and if they do not prove profitable they will be withdraw the problem of transportation over inland waterway should be take up by private enterprise so that the public will have the advantage of competition in service it be expect that some of our line can be sell some more demonstration work do and that with the completion of the ohio project a policy of private operation can be fully develop prohibition after more than two generation of constant debate our country adopt a system of national prohibition under all the solemnity involve in an amendment to the federal constitution in obedience to this mandate the congress and the states with one or two notable exception have pass require law for its administration and enforcement this impose upon the citizenship of the country and especially on all public officer not only the duty to enforce but the obligation to observe the sanction of this constitutional provision and its result law if this condition could be secure all question concern prohibition would cease the federal government be make every effort to accomplish these result through careful organization large appropriation and administrative effort smuggling have be greatly cut down the large source of supply for illegal sale have be check and by mean of injunction and criminal prosecution the process of enforcement be be apply the same vigilance on the part of local government would render these effort much more successful the federal authority propose to discharge their obligation for enforcement to the full extent of their ability the negro history do not anywhere record so much progress make in the same length of time as that which have be accomplish by the negro race in the united states since the emancipation proclamation they have come up from slavery to be prominent in education the profession art science agriculture banking and commerce it be estimate that 50,000 of they be on the government pay roll draw about $ 50,000,000 each year they have be the recipient of presidential appointment and their professional ability have arise to a sufficiently high plane so that they have be intrust with the entire management and control of the great veteran hospital at tuskegee where their conduct have take high rank they have show that they have be worthy of all the encouragement which they have receive nevertheless they be too often subject to thoughtless and inconsiderate treatment unworthy alike of the white or colored race they have especially be make the target of the foul crime of lynch for several year these act of unlawful violence have be diminish in the last year they have show an increase every principle of order and law and liberty be oppose to this crime the congress should enact any legislation it can under the constitution to provide for its elimination american indian the condition of the american indian have much improve in recent year full citizenship be bestow upon they on june 2 1924 and appropriation for their care and advancement have be increase still there remain much to be do notable increase in appropriation for the several major function perform by the department of the interior on behalf of the indians have mark the last five year in that time successive annual increase in appropriation for their education total $ 1,804,325 for medical care $ 578,000 and for industrial advancement $ 205,000 or $ 2,582,325 more than would have be spend in the same period on the basis of appropriation for 1923 and the precede year the need along health educational industrial and social line however be great and the budget estimate for 1929 include still further increase for indian administration to advance the time when the indians may become self sustain it be my belief that the federal government should continue to improve the facility for their care and as rapidly as possible turn its responsibility over to the states coal legislation authorize a system of fuel administration and the appointment by the president of a board of mediation and conciliation in case of actual or threatened interruption of production be need the miner themselves be now seek information and action from the government which could readily be secure through such a board it be believe that a thorough investigation and reconsideration of this propose policy by the congress will demonstrate that this recommendation be sound and should be adopt petroleum conservation the national government be undertake to join in the formation of a cooperative committee of lawyer engineer and public officer to consider what legislation by the states or by the congress can be adopt for the preservation and conservation of our supply of petroleum this have come to be one of the main dependency for transportation and power so necessary to our agricultural and industrial life it be expect the report of this committee will be available for later congressional action meantime the requirement that the secretary of the interior should make certain lease of land belong to the osage indians in accordance with the act of march 3 1921 should be repeal the authority to lease should be discretionary in order that the property of the indians way not be waste and the public suffer a future lack of supply alien property under treaty the property hold by the alien property custodian be to be retain until suitable provision have be make for the satisfaction of american claim while still protect the american claimant in order to afford every possible accommodation to the national of the country whose property be hold the congress have make liberal provision for the return of a large part of the property all trust under $ 10,000 be return in full and partial return be make on the other the total return be approximately $ 350,000,000.there be still retain however about $ 250,000,000 the mixed claims commission have make such progress in the adjudication of claim that legislation can now be enact provide for the return of the property which should be do under condition which will protect our government and our claimant such a measure will be propose and i recommend its enactment railroad consolidation in order to increase the efficiency of transportation and decrease its cost to the shipper railroad consolidation must be secure legislation be need to simplify the necessary procedure to secure such agreement and arrangement for consolidation always under the control and with the approval of the interstate commerce commission pende this no adequate or permanent reorganization can be make of the freight rate structure meantime both agriculture and industry be compel to wait for needed relief

sum of money be annually appropriate to carry on vocational training many million go into agricultural school the general subject be under the immediate direction of a commissioner of education while

his heroic character and the importance of his victory be too little known and understand they give we not only this northwest territory but by mean of that the prospect of reach the pacific the state of indiana be propose to dedicate the site of fort sackville as a national shrine the federal government may well make some provision for the erection under its own management of a fitting memorial at that point foreign relation it be the policy of the united states to promote peace we be a peaceful people and commit to the settling of dispute by amicable adjustment rather than by force we have believe that peace can well be secure by a faithful observance on our part of the principle of international law accompany by patience and conciliation and require of other a like treatment for

between the two government we have be compel to send naval and marine force to china to protect the life and property of our citizen fortunately their simple presence there have be sufficient to prevent any material loss of life but there have be considerable loss of property that unhappy country be tear by faction and revolution which bid fair to last for an indefinite period meanwhile we be protect our citizen and stand ready to cooperate with any government which may emerge in promote the welfare of the people of china they have always have our friendship and they should especially merit our consideration in these day of their distraction and distress we be confront by similar condition on a small scale in nicaragua our marine and naval force protect our citizen and their

constitution to make american progress our country have make much progress but it have take and will continue to take much effort competition will be keen the temptation to selfishness and arrogance

spirit of neighborly kindness the force of the universe be take humanity in that direction in do good in walk humbly in sustain its own people in minister to other nation america will work out its own mighty destiny
this campaign now draw near a close the platform of the two party define principle and offer solution of various national problem have be present and be be earnestly consider by our people after four month debate it be not the republican party which find reason for abandonment of any of the principle it have lay down or of the view it have express for solution of the problem before the country the principle to which it adhere be root deeply in the foundation of our national life the solution which it propose be base on experience with government and on a consciousness that it may have the responsibility for place those solution in action in my acceptance speech i endeavor to outline the spirit and ideal by which i would be guide in carry that platform into administration tonight i will not deal with the multitude of issue which have be already well canvass i intend rather to discuss some of those more fundamental principle and ideal upon which i believe the government of the united states should be conduct the republican party have ever be a party of progress i do not need to review its seventy year of constructive history it have always reflect the spirit of the american people never have it do more for the advancement of fundamental progress than during the past seven and a half year since we take over the government amidst the ruin leave by war it detract nothing from the character and energy of the american people it minimize in no degree the quality of their accomplishment to say that the policy of the republican party have play a large part in recuperation from the war and the building of the magnificent progress which show upon every hand today i say with emphasis that without the wise policy which the republican party have bring into action during this period no such progress would have be possible the first responsibility of the republican administration be to renew the march of progress from its collapse by the war that task involve the restoration of confidence in the future and the liberation and stimulation of the constructive energy of our people it discharge that task there be not a person within the sound of my voice that do not know the profound progress which our country have make in this period every man and woman know that american comfort hope and confidence for the future be immeasurably high this day than they be seven and one half year ago it be not my purpose to enter upon a detailed recital of the great constructive measure of the past seven and a half year by which this have be bring about it be sufficient to remind you of the restoration of employment to the million who walk your street in idleness to remind you of the creation of the budget system the reduction of six billion of national debt which give the powerful impulse of that vast sum return to industry and commerce the four sequent reduction of taxis and thereby the lift to the living of every family the enactment of adequate protective tariff and immigration law which have safeguard our worker and farmer from flood of good and labor from foreign country the creation of credit facility and many other aid to agriculture the building up of foreign trade the care of veteran the development of aviation of radio of our inland waterway of our highway the expansion of scientific research of welfare activity the making of safe highway safe mine well home the spread of outdoor recreation the improvement in public health and the care of child and a score of other progressive action nor do i need to remind you that government today deal with an economic and social system vastly more intricate and delicately adjusted than ever before that system now must be keep in perfect tune if we would maintain uninterrupted employment and the high standard of living of our people the government have come to touch this delicate web at a thousand point yearly the relation of government to national prosperity become more and more intimate only through keen vision and helpful cooperation by the government have stability in business and stability in employment be maintain during this past seven and a half year there always be some locality some industry and some individual who do not share the prevail prosperity the task of government be to lessen these inequality never have there be a period when the federal government have give such aid and impulse to the progress of our people not alone to economic progress but to the development of those agency which make for moral and spiritual progress but in addition to this great record of contribution of the republican party to progress there have be a further fundamental contribution&mdash;a contribution underlie and sustain all the others&mdash;and that be the resistance of the republican party to every attempt to inject the government into business in competition with its citizen after the war when the republican party assume administration of the country we be face with the problem of determination of the very nature of our national life during 150 year we have build up a form of self government and a social system which be peculiarly our own it differ essentially from all other in the world it be the american system it be just as definite and positive a political and social system as have ever be develop on earth it be found upon a particular conception of self government in which decentralize local responsibility be the very base far than this it be found upon the conception that only through order liberty freedom and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise spur on the march of progress and in our insistence upon equality of opportunity have our system advance beyond all the world during the war we necessarily turn to the government to solve every difficult economic problem the government having absorb every energy of our people for war there be no other solution for the preservation of the state the federal government become a centralized despotism which undertake unprecedented responsibility assume autocratic power and take over the business of citizen to a large degree we regiment our whole people temporarily into a socialistic state however justify in time of war if continue in peace time it would destroy not only our american system but with it our progress and freedom as well when the war close the most vital of all issue both in our own country and throughout the world be whether government should continue their wartime ownership and operation of many instrumentality of production and distribution we be challenge with a peace time choice between the american system of rugged individualism and a european philosophy of diametrically oppose doctrines&mdash;doctrine of paternalism and state socialism the acceptance of these idea would have mean the destruction of self government through centralization of government it would have mean the undermining of the individual initiative and enterprise through which our people have grow to unparalleled greatness the republican party from the beginning resolutely turn its face away from these idea and these war practice a republican congress cooperate with the democratic administration to demobilize many of our war activity at that time the two party be accord upon that point when the republican party come into full power it go at once resolutely back to our fundamental conception of the state and the right and responsibility of the individual thereby it restore confidence and hope in the american people it free and stimulated enterprise it restore the government to its position as an umpire instead of a player in the economic game for these reason the american people have go forward in progress while the rest of the world have halt and some country have even go backwards if anyone will study the cause of retarded recuperation in europe he will find much of it due to the stifling of private initiative on one hand and overload of the government with business on the other there have be revive in this campaign however a series of proposal which if adopt would be a long step toward the abandonment of our american system and a surrender to the destructive operation of governmental conduct of commercial business because the country be face with difficulty and doubt over certain national problems&mdash;that be prohibition farm relief and electrical power&mdash;our opponent propose that we must thrust government a long way into the business which give rise to these problem in effect they abandon the tenet of their own party and turn to state socialism as a solution for the difficulty present by all three it be propose that we shall change from prohibition to the state purchase and sale of liquor if their agricultural relief program mean anything it mean that the government shall directly or indirectly buy and sell and fix price of agricultural product and we be to go into the hydroelectric power business in other word we be confront with a huge program of government in business there be therefore submit to the american people a question of fundamental principle that be shall we depart from the principle of our american political and economic system upon which we have advance beyond all the rest of the world in order to adopt method base on principle destructive of its very foundation and i wish to emphasize the seriousness of these proposal i wish to make my position clear for this go to the very root of american life and progress i should like to state to you the effect that this projection of government in business would have upon our system of self government and our economic system that effect would reach to the daily life of every man and woman it would impair the very basis of liberty and freedom not only for those leave outside the fold of expand bureaucracy but for those embrace within it let we first see the effect upon self government when the federal government undertake to go into commercial business it must at once set up the organization and administration of that business and it immediately find itself in a labyrinth every alley of which lead to the destruction of self government commercial business require a concentration of responsibility self government require decentralization and many check and balance to safeguard liberty our government to succeed in business would need become in effect a despotism there at once begin the destruction of self government the first problem of the government about to adventure in commercial business be to determine a method of administration it must secure leadership and direction shall this leadership be choose by political agency or shall we make it elective the hard practical fact be that leadership in business must come through the sheer rise in ability and character that rise can only take place in the free atmosphere of competition competition be close by bureaucracy political agency be feeble channel through which to select able leader to conduct commercial business government in order to avoid the possible incompetence corruption and tyranny of too great authority in individual entrust with commercial business inevitably turn to board and commission to make sure that there be check and balance each member of such board and commission must have equal authority each have his separate responsibility to the public and at once we have the conflict of idea and the lack of decision which would ruin any commercial business it have contribute greatly to the demoralization of our shipping business moreover these commission must be representative of different section and different political party so that at once we have an entire blight upon coordinate action within their rank which destroy any possibility of effective administration moreover our legislative body can not in fact delegate their full authority to commission or to individual for the conduct of matter vital to the american people for if we would preserve government by the people we must preserve the authority of our legislator in the activity of our government thus every time the federal government go into a commercial business 531 senators and congressman become the actual board of director of that business every time a state government go into business one or two hundred state senator and legislator become the actual director of that business even if they be superman and if there be no politic in the united states no body of such number could competently direct commercial activity for that require initiative instant decision and action it take congress six year of constant discussion to even decide what the method of administration of muscle shoals should be when the federal government undertake to go into business the state government be at once deprive of control and taxation of that business when a state government undertake to go into business it at once deprive the municipality of taxation and control of that business municipality be local and close to the people can at time succeed in business where federal and state governments must fail we have trouble enough with log roll in legislative body today it originate naturally from desire of citizen to advance their particular section or to secure some necessary service it would be multiply a thousandfold be the federal and state government in these business the effect upon our economic progress would be even bad business progressiveness be dependent on competition new method and new idea be the outgrowth of the spirit of adventure of individual initiative and of individual enterprise without adventure there be no progress no government administration can rightly take chance with taxpayer money there be no well example of the practical incompetence of government to conduct business than the history of our railway during the war the government find it necessary to operate the railway that operation continue until after the war in the year before be free from government operation they be not able to meet the demand for transportation eight year later we find they under private enterprise transport 15 per cent more good and meet every demand for service rate have be reduce by 15 per cent and net earning increase from less than 1 per cent on their valuation to about 5 per cent wage of employee have improve by 13 per cent the wage of railway employee be today 121 per cent above pre war while the wage of government employee be today only 65 per cent above pre war that should be a sufficient commentary upon the efficiency of government operation let we now examine this question from the point of view of the person who may get a government job and be admit into the new bureaucracy upon that subject let i quote from a speech of that great leader of labor samuel gompers deliver in montreal in 1920 a few year before his death he said:"i believe there be no man to whom i would take second position in my loyalty to the republic of the united states and yet i would not give it more power over the individual citizenship of our country it be a question of whether it shall be government ownership or private ownership under control   if i be in the minority of one in this convention i would want to cast my vote so that the man of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to government authority in their industrial effort for freedom let the future tell the story of who be right or who be wrong who have stand for freedom and who have be willing to submit their fate industrially to the government "i would amplify mr. gompers statement the great body of government employee which would be create by the proposal of our opponent would either comprise a political machine at the disposal of the party in power or alternatively to prevent this the government by stringent civil service rule must debar its employee from their full political right as free man it must limit they in the liberty to bargain for their own wage for no government employee can strike against his government and thus against the whole people it make a legislative body with all its political current their final employer and master their bargaining do not rest upon economic need or economic strength but on political potence but what of those who be outside the bureaucracy what be the effect upon their lives?the area of enterprise and opportunity for they to strive and rise be at once limit the government in commercial business do not tolerate amongst its customer the freedom of competitive reprisal to which private business be subject bureaucracy do not tolerate the spirit of independence it spread the spirit of submission into our daily life and penetrate the temper of our people not with the habit of powerful resistance to wrong but with the habit of timid acceptance of irresistible might bureaucracy be ever desirous of spread its influence and its power you can not extend the mastery of the government over the daily work life of a people without at the same time make it the master of the people 's soul and thought every expansion of government in business mean that government in order to protect itself from the political consequence of its error and wrong be drive irresistibly without peace to great and great control of the nation press and platform free speech do not live many hour after free industry and free commerce die it be a false liberalism that interpret itself into the government operation of commercial business every step of bureaucratizing of the business of our country poison the very root of liberalism&mdash;that be political equality free speech free assembly free press and equality of opportunity it be the road not to more liberty but to less liberty liberalism should be find not strive to spread bureaucracy but strive to set bound to it true liberalism seek all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of all other blessing and benefit be vain that belief be the foundation of all american progress political as well as economic liberalism be a force truly of the spirit a force proceed from the deep realization that economic freedom can not be sacrifice if political freedom be to be preserve even if governmental conduct of business could give we more efficiency instead of less efficiency the fundamental objection to it would remain unaltered and unabated it would destroy political equality it would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption it would stifle initiative and invention it would undermine the development of leadership it would cramp and cripple the mental and spiritual energy of our people it would extinguish equality and opportunity it would dry up the spirit of liberty and progress for these reason primarily it must be resist for a hundred and fifty year liberalism have find its true spirit in the american system not in the european system i do not wish to be misunderstood in this statement i be define a general policy it do not mean that our government be to part with one iota of its national resource without complete protection to the public interest i have already state that where the government be engage in public work for purpose of flood control of navigation of irrigation of scientific research or national defense or in pioneer a new art it will at time necessarily produce power or commodity as a by product but they must be a by product of the major purpose not the major purpose itself nor do i wish to be misinterpret as believe that the united states be free for all and devil take the hind most the very essence of equality of opportunity and of american individualism be that there shall be no domination by any group or combination in this republic whether it be business or political on the contrary it demand economic justice as well as political and social justice it be no system of laissez faire i feel deeply on this subject because during the war i have some practical experience with governmental operation and control i have witness not only at home but abroad the many failure of government in business i have see its tyranny its injustice its destruction of self government its undermining of the very instinct which carry our people forward to progress i have witness the lack of advance the lower standard of living the depressed spirit of people work under such a system my objection be base not upon theory or upon a failure to recognize wrong or abuse but i know the adoption of such method would strike at the very root of american life and would destroy the very basis of american progress our people have the right to know whether we can continue to solve our great problem without abandonment of our american system i know we can we have demonstrate that our system be responsive enough to meet any new and intricate development in our economic and business life we have demonstrate that we can meet any economic problem and still maintain our democracy as master in its own house and that we can at the same time preserve equality of opportunity and individual freedom in the last fifty year we have discover that mass production will produce article for we at half the cost they require previously we have see the resultant growth of large unit of production and distribution this be big business many business must be big for our tool be big our country be big we now build a single dynamo of a hundred thousand horsepower even fifteen year ago that would have be a big business all by itself yet today advance in production require that we set ten of these unit together in a row the american people from bitter experience have a rightful fear that great business unit might be use to dominate our industrial life and by illegal and unethical practice destroy equality of opportunity year ago the republican administration establish the principle that such evil could be correct by regulation it develop method by which abuse could be prevent while the full value of industrial progress could be retain for the public it insist upon the principle that when great public utility be clothe with the security of partial monopoly whether it be railway power plant telephone or what not then there must be the full and most complete control of rate service and finance by government or local agency it declare that these business must be conduct with glass pocket as to our great manufacturing and distribute industry the republican party insist up on the enactment of law that not only would maintain competition but would destroy conspiracy to destroy the small unit or dominate and limit the equality of opportunity amongst our people one of the great problem of government be to determine to what extent the government shall regulate and control commerce and industry and how much it shall leave it alone no system be perfect we have have many abuse in the private conduct of business that every good citizen resent it be just as important that business keep out of government as that government keep out of business nor be i set up the contention that our institution be perfect no human ideal be ever perfectly attain since humanity itself be not perfect the wisdom of our forefather in their conception that progress can only be attain as the sum of the accomplishment of free individual have be re enforce by all of the great leader of the country since that day jackson lincoln cleveland mckinley roosevelt wilson and coolidge have stand unalterably for these principle and what have be the result of our american system our country have become the land of opportunity to those bear without inheritance not merely because of the wealth of its resource and industry but because of this freedom of initiative and enterprise russia have natural resource equal to ours her people be equally industrious but she have not have the blessing of 150 year of our form of government and of our social system by adherence to the principle of decentralized self government order liberty equal opportunity and freedom to the individual our american experiment in human welfare have yield a degree of well be unparalleled in all the world it have come near to the abolition of poverty to the abolition of fear of want than humanity have ever reach before progress of the past seven year be the proof of it this alone furnish the answer to our opponent who ask we to introduce destructive element into the system by which this have be accomplish let we see what this system have do for we in our recent year of difficult and try reconstruction and let we then solemnly ask ourselves if we now wish to abandon it as a nation we come out of the war with great loss we make no profit from it the apparent increase in wage be at that time fictitious we be poor as a nation when we emerge from the war yet during these last eight year we have recover from these loss and increase our national income by over one third even if we discount the inflation of the dollar that there have be a wide diffusion of our gain in wealth and income be mark by a hundred proof i know of no well test of the improve condition of the average family than the combine increase in asset of life and industrial insurance building and loan association and saving deposit these be the saving bank of the average man these agency alone have in seven year increase by nearly 100 per cent to the gigantic sum of over 50 billion of dollar or nearly one sixth of our whole national wealth we have increase in home ownership we have expand the investment of the average man in addition t o these evidence of large saving our people be steadily increase their spending for high standard of living today there be almost 9 automobile for each 10 family where seven and a half year ago only enough automobile be run to average less than 4 for each 10 family the slogan of progress be change from the full dinner pail to the full garage our people have more to eat well thing to wear and well home we have even gain in elbow room for the increase of residential floor space be over 25 per cent with less than 10 per cent increase in our number of people wage have increase the cost of living have decrease the job to every man and woman have be make more secure we have in this short period decrease the fear of poverty the fear of unemployment the fear of old age and these be fear that be the great calamity of human kind all this progress mean far more than great creature comfort it find a thousand interpretation into a great and full life a score of new help save the drudgery of the home in seven year we have add 70 per cent to the electric power at the elbow of our worker and far promote they from carrier of burden to director of machine we have steadily reduce the sweat in human labor our hour of labor be lessen our leisure have increase we have expand our park and playground we have nearly double our attendance at game we pour into outdoor recreation in every direction the visitor at our national park have treble and we have so increase the number of sportsman fish in our stream and lake that the long time between bite be become a political issue in these seven and one half year the radio have bring music and laughter education and political discussion to almost every fireside spring from our prosperity with its great freedom its vast endowment of scientific research and the great resource with which to care for public health we have accord to our insurance actuary during this short period since the war lengthen the average span of life by nearly eight

by 80 per cent and in our institution of high learning by 95 per cent today we have more youth in these institution of high learning twice over than all the rest of the world put together we have make notable progress in literature in art and in public taste we have make progress in the leadership of every branch of american life never in our history be the leadership in our economic life more distinguished in its ability than today and it have grow greatly in its consciousness of public responsibility leadership in our professions&mdash;and in moral and spiritual affair of our country be never of a high order and our magnificent educational system be bring forward a host of recruit for the succession to this leadership i do not need to recite more figure and more evidence i can not believe that the american people wish to abandon or in any way to weaken the principle of economic freedom and self government which have be maintain by the republican party and which have produce result so amazing and so stimulating to the spiritual as well as to the material advance of the nation your city have be an outstanding beneficiary of this great progress and of these safeguard principle with its suburb it have during the last seven and a half year grow by over a million and a half of people until it have become the large metropolitan district of all the world here you have make abundant opportunity not only for the youth of the land but for the immigrant from foreign shore this city be the commercial center of the united states it be the commercial agent of the american

people it lead our nation in its benevolence to charity to education and scientific research it be the center of art music literature and drama it have come to have a more potent voice than any other city in the united states but when all be say and do the very life progress and prosperity of this city be wholly dependent on the prosperity of the 115,000,000 people who dwell in our mountain and valley across the 3,000 mile to the pacific ocean every activity of this city be sensitive to every evil and every favorable tide that sweep this great nation of ours be there a slackening of industry

prosperity the citizen of the great interior of our country pour into your city for business and entertainment at the rate of 150,000 a day in fact so much be this city the reflex of the varied interest of our country that the concern of everyone of your citizen for national stability for national prosperity for national progress for preservation of our american system be far great than that of any other single part of our country we still have great problem if we would achieve the full economic advancement of our country in these past few year some group in our country have lag behind other in the march of progress i refer more particularly to those engage in the textile coal and in the agricultural industry we can assist in solve these problem by cooperation of our government to the agricultural industry we shall need to advance initial capital to assist they to stabilize their industry but this proposal imply that they shall conduct it themselves and not by the government it be in the interest of our city that we shall bring agriculture and all industry into full stability and prosperity i know you will gladly cooperate in the faith that in the common prosperity of our country lie its future in bring this address to a conclusion i should like to restate to you some of the fundamental thing i have endeavor to bring out the foundation of progress and prosperity be dependent as never before upon the wise policy of government for government now touch at a thousand point the intricate web of economic and social life under administration by the republican party in the last 7 1/2 year our country as a whole have make unparalleled progress and this have be in generous part reflect to this great city prosperity be no idle expression it be a job for every worker it be the safety and the safeguard of every business and every home a continuation of the policy of the republican party be fundamentally necessary to the further advancement of this progress and to the further building up of this prosperity i have dwell at some length on the principle of relationship between the government and business i make no apology for deal with this subject the first necessity of any nation be the smooth functioning of the vast business machinery for employment feeding clothing housing and provide luxury and comfort to a people unless these basic element be properly organize and function there can be no progress in business in education literature music or art there can be no advance in the fundamental ideal of a people a people can not make progress in poverty i have endeavor to present to you that the greatness of america have grow out of a political and social system and a method of control of economic force distinctly its own&mdash;our american system&mdash;which have carry this great experiment in human welfare far than ever before in all history we be near today to the ideal of the abolition of poverty and fear from the life of man and woman than ever before in any land and i again repeat that the departure from our american system by inject principle destructive to it which our opponent propose will jeopardize the very liberty and freedom of our people will destroy equality of opportunity not alone to ourselves but to our child to i the foundation of american life rest upon the home and the family i read into these great economic force these intricate and delicate relation of the government with business and with our political and social life but one supreme end&mdash;that we reinforce the tie that bind together the million of our family that we strengthen the security the happiness and the independence of every home my conception of america be a land where man and woman may walk in order freedom in the independent conduct of their occupation where they may enjoy the advantage of wealth not concentrate in the hand of the few but spread through the life of all where they build and safeguard their home

happy people secure in their liberty free from poverty and fear shall have the leisure and impulse to seek a full life some may ask where all this may lead beyond mere material progress it lead to a release of the energy of man and woman from the dull drudgery of life to a wide vision and a high hope it lead to the opportunity for great and great service not alone from man to man in our own land but from our country to the whole world it lead to an america healthy in body healthy in spirit unfettered youthful eager&mdash;with a vision search beyond the farth horizon with an open mind sympathetic and generous it be to these high ideal and for these purpose that i pledge myself and the republican party
to the congress of the united states no congress of the united states ever assemble on survey the state of the union have meet with a more pleasing prospect than that which appear at the present time in the domestic field there be tranquility and contentment harmonious relation between management and wage earner freedom from industrial strife and the high record of year of prosperity in the foreign field there be peace the good will which come from mutual understanding and the knowledge that the problem which a short time ago appear so ominous be yield to the touch of manifest friendship the great wealth create by our enterprise and industry and save by our economy have have the wide distribution among our own people and have go out in a steady stream to serve the charity and the business of the world the requirement of existence have pass beyond the standard of necessity into the region of luxury enlarging production be consume by an increase demand at hom6 and ail expand commerce abroad the country can regard the present with satisfaction and anticipate the future with optimism the main source of these unexampled blessing lie in the integrity and character of the american people they have have great faith which they have supplement with inighty work they have be able to put trust in each other and trust in their government their candor in deal with foreign government hag command respect and confidence yet these remarkable power would have be exert almost in vain without the constant cooperation and careful administration of the federal government we have be come into a period which may be fairly characterized as a conservation of our national resource wastefulness in public business and private enterprise have be displace by constructive economy this have be accomplish by bring our domestic and foreign relation more and more under a reign of law a rule of force have be give way to a rule of reason we have substitute for the vicious circle of increase expenditure increase tax rate and diminish profit the charmed circle of diminish expenditure diminish tax rate and increase profit four time we have make a drastic revision of our internal revenue system abolish many taxis and substantially reduce almost all other each time the result stimulation to business have so increase taxable income and profit that a surplus have be ro duce one third of the national debt have be pay while much of the other two third have be refund at low rate and these saving of interest and constant economy have enable we to repeat the satisfying process of more tax reduction under this sound and healthful encouragement the national income have increase nearly 50 per cent until it be estimate to stand well over $ 90,000,000,000 it gas be a method which have perform the secine miracle of leave a much great percentage of earning in the hand of the taxpayer with scarcely any diminution of the government revenue that be constructive economy in the high degree it be the corner stone of prosperity it should not fail to be continue this action begin by the application of economy to public expenditure if it be to be permanent it must be make so by the repeat application of economy there be no surplus on which to base further tax revision at this time last june the estimate show a threatened deficit for the current fiscal year of $ 94,000,000 under my direction the department begin save all they could out of their present appropriation the last tax reduction bring an encouraging improvement in business begin early in october which w1,11 also increase our revenue the combination of economy and good time now indicate a surplus of about $ 37,000,000 this be a margin of less than i percent on out expenditure and make it obvious that the treasury be in no condition to undertake increase in diture to be make before june 30 it be necessary therefor"stue the present session to refrain from new appropriation for immediate outlay or if such be absolutely require to provide for they by new revenue otherwise we shall reach the end of the year with the unthinkable result of an unbalanced budget for the first time during my term of office we face that contingency i be certain that the congress would not pass and i should not feel warrant in approve legislation which would involve we in that financial disgrace on the whole the finance of the government be most satisfactory last year the national debt be reduce about $ 906,000,000 the refunding and retirement of the second and third liberty loan have just be bring to a successful conclusion which will save about $ 75,000,0w a year in interest the unpaid balance have be arrangedin maturity convenient for carry out our permanent debt pay program the enormous saving make have not be at the expense of any legitimate public need the government plant have be keep up and many improvement be tinder way while its service be fully man and the general efficiency of operation have increase we have be enable to undertake many new enterprise among these be the adjusted compensation of the veteran of the world war which be cost we $ 112,000,000 a year amortize our liability to the civil service retirement fund $ 20,000,000 increase of expenditure for river and harbor include flood control $ 43,000,000 public building $ 47,000,000 in 1928 we spend $ 50,000,000 in the adjustment of war claim and alien property these be example of a large list of item foreign reiation when we turn from our domestic affair to our foreign relation we likewise perceive peace and progress the sixth international conference of american states be hold at habana last winter it contribute to a well understanding and cooperation among the nation eleven important convention be sign and 71 resolution pass pursuant to the plan then adopt this government have invite the other 20 nation of this hemisphere to it conference on conciliation and arbitration which meet in washington on december 10 all the nation have accept and the expectation be justify that important progress will be make in method for resolve international difference by mean of arbitration during the year we have sign 11 new arbitration treaty and 22 more be tinder negotiation nicaragua when a destructive and bloody revolution lately break out in nicaragua at the earnest and repeat entreaty of its government i dispatch our marine force there to protect the life and interest of our citizen to compose the contend party i send there col henry l. stimson former secretary of war and now governor general of the philippine islands who secure an agreement that warfare should cease a national election should be hold and peace should be restore both party conscientiously carry out this agreement with the exception of a few bandit who later mostly surrender or leave the country president diaz appoint brig gen. frank r. mccoy united states army president of the election board which include also one member of each political party a free and fair election have be hold and have work out so successfully that both party have join in request like cooperation from this country at the election four year hence to which i have refrain from make any commitment although our country must be gratify at such an exhibition of success and appreciationnicaragua be regain its prosperity and have take a long step in the direction of peaceful self government tacna arica the long stand difference between chile and peru have be sufficiently compose so that diplomatic relation have be resume by the exchange of ambassador negotiation be hopefully proceed as this be write for the final adjustment of the difference over their dispute territory mexico our relation with mexico be on a more satisfactory basis than at any time since their revolution many misunderstanding have be resolve and the most frank and friendly negotiation promise a final adjustment of all unsettled question it be exceedingly gratifying that ambassador morrow have be able to bring our two neighboring country which have so many interest in common to a position of confidence in each other and of respect for mutual sovereign right china the situation in china which a few month ago be so threatening as to call for the dispatch of a large additional force have be much compose the nationalist government have establish itself over the country and promulgate a new organic law announce a program intend to promote the political and economic welfare of the people we have recognize this government encourage its progress and have negotiate a treaty restore to china completetariff autonomy and guarantee our citizen against discrimination our trade in that quarter be increase and our force be be reduce greek and austrian debt pende before the congress be a recommendation for the settlement of the greek debt and the austrian debt both of these be comparatively small and our country can afford to be generous the rehabilitation of these country await their settlement there would also be advantage to our trade we could scarcely afford to be the only nation that refuse the relief which austria seek the congress have already grant austria a long time moratorium which it be understand will be waive and immediate payment begin on her debt on the same basis which we have extend to other country peace treaty one of the most important treaty ever lay before the senate of the united states will be that which the 15 nation recently sign at paris and to which 44 other nation have declare their intention to adhere renounce war as a national policy and agree to resort only to peaceful mean for the adjustment of international difference it be the most solemn declaration against war the most positive adherence to peace that it be possible for sovereign nation tomake it do not supersede our inalienable sovereign right and duty of national defense or undertake to commit we before the event to any mode of action which the congress might decide to be wise it ever the treaty should be break but it be a new standard in the world around which can rally the informed and enlightened opinion of nation to prevent their government from beii4'force into hostile action by the temporary outbreak of international animosity the observance of this covenant so simple and so straightforward promise more for the peace of the world than any other agreement ever negotiate among the nation national defense the first duty of our government to its own citizen and foreigner within its border be the preservation of order unless and until that duty be meet a government be not even eligible for recognition among the family of nation the advancement of world civilization likewise be dependent upon that order among the people of different country which we term peace to insure our citizen against the infringement of their legal right at home and abroad to preserve order liberty and peace by make the law supreme we have an army and a navy both of these be organize for defensive purpose our army could not be much reduce but do not need to be increase such new housing and repair as be necessary be tinder way and the 6 year program in aviation be be put into effect in both branch of our service our navy accord to generally accept standard be deficient in cruiser we have 10 comparatively new vessel 22 that be old and 8 to be build it be evident that renewal and replacement must be provide this matter be thoroughly canvass at the last session of the congress and do not need restatement the bill before the senate with the elimination of the time clause should be pass we have no intention of compete with any other country this building program be for necessary replacement and to meet our need for defense the cost of national defense be stupendous it have increase $ 118,000,000 in the past four year the estimate expenditure for 1930 be $ 668,000,000 while this be make up of many item it be after all mostly dependent upon number our defensive need do not can for any increase in the number of man in the army or the navy we have reach the limit of what we ought to expend for that purpose i wish to repeat again for the benefit of the timid and the suspicious that this country be neither militaristic nor imperialistic many people at home and abroad who constantly make this charge be the same one who be even more solicitous to have we extend assistance to foreign country when such assistance be grant the inevitable result be that we have foreign interest for we to refuse the customary support and protection of such interest would be in derogation of the sovereignty of this nation our large foreign interest be in the british empire france and italy because we be constantly solicitous for those interest i doubt if anyone would suppose that those country feel we harbor toward they any militaristic or imperialistic design as for small country we certainly do not want any of they we be more anxious than they be to have their sovereignty respect our entire influence be in behalf of their independence cuba stand as a witness to our adherence to this principle the position of this government relative to the limitation of armament the result already secure and the development up to the present time be so well known to the congress that they do not require any restatement veterans the magnitude of our present system of veteran relief be without precedent and the result have be far reaching for year a service pension have be grant to the grand army and lately to the survivor of the spanish american war at the time we enter the world war however congress depart from the usual pension system follow by our gove2rnment eleven year have elapse since our law be first enact initiate a system of compensation rehabilitation hospitalization and insurance for the disabled of the world war and their dependent the administration of all the law concern relief have be a difficult task but it can safely be state that these measure have omit nothing in their desire to deal generously and humanely we should continue to foster this system and provide all the facility necessary for adequate care it be the conception of our government that the pension roll be an honor roll it should include all those who be justly entitle to its benefit but exclude all other annual expenditure for all form of veteran relief now approximate $ 765,000,000 and be increase from year to year it be doubtful if the peak of expenditure will be reach even under present legislation for sonic time yet to come further amendment to the exist law will be suggest by the american legion the veterans of foreign wars of the united states the disabled american veterans of the world war and other like organization and it may be necessary for administrative purpose or in order to remove some exist inequality in the present law to make further change i be sure that such recommendation its may be submit to the congress will receive your careful consideration but because of the vast expenditure now be make each year with every assurance that it will increase and because of the great liberality of the exist law the proposal of any additional legislation deal with this subject should receive most searching scrutiny from the congress you be familiar with the suggestion that the various public agency now deal with matter of veteran relief be consolidate in one government department some advantage to this plan seem apparent especially in the simplification of administration find in the opportunity of bring about a great uniformity in the application of veteran relief i recommend that a survey be make by the proper committee of congress deal with this subject in order to determine whether legislation to secure this consolidation be desirable agriculture the past year have be mark by notable though not uniform improvement in agriculture the general purchasing power of farmproduct and the volume of production have advance this mean not only further progress in overcome the price disparity into which agriculture be plunge in 1920 21 but also increase efficiency on the part of farmer and a well ground confidence in the future of agriculture the livestock industry have attain the good balance for many year and be prosper conspicuously dairymen beef producer an poultryman be receive substantially large return than last year cotton although low in price than at this time last year be produce in great volume and the prospect for cotton income be favorable but progress be never uniform in a vast and highly diversified agriculture or industry cash grain hay tobacco and potato will bring somewhat small return this year than last present indication be however that the gross farm income will be somewhat large than in the crop year 1927 28 when the total be $ 12,253,000,000 the corresponding figure for 1926 27 be $ 12,127,000,000 and in 1925 26 $ 12,670,000,000 still well result would have be secure this year have there not be an undue increase in the production of certain crop this be particularly true of potato which have sell at an unremunerative price or at a loss as a direct result of overexpansion of acreage the present status of agriculture although greatly improve over that of a few year ago bespeak the need of further improvemen4 which call for determined effort of farmer themselves encourage and assist by wise public policy the government have be and must continue to be alive to the need of agriculture in the past eight year more constructive legislation of direct benefit to agriculture have be adopt than during any other period the department of agriculture have be broaden and reorganize to insure great efficiency the department be lay great stress on the economic and business phase of agriculture it be lend every possible assistance to cooperative marketing association regulatory and research work have be segregate in order that each field may be serve more effectively i can not too strongly commend in the field of fact finding the research work of the department of agriculture and the state experiment station the department now receive annually $ 4,000,000 more for research than in 1921 in addition the fund pay to the states for experimentation purpose under the purnell act constitute an annual increase in federal payment to state agricultural experiment station of $ 2,400,000 over the amount appropriate in 1921 the program of support for research may wisely be continue and expand since 1921 we have appropriate nearly an additional $ 2,000,000 for extension work and this sum be to be increase next year under authorization by the capper ketcham act the surplus problem while these development in fundamental research regulation and dissemination of agricultural information be of distinct hell to agriculture additional effort be need the surplus problem demand attention as emphasize in my last message the government should assume no responsibility in normal time for crop surplus clearly due to overextend acreage the government should however provide reliable information as a guide to private effort and in this connection fundamental research on prospective supply and demand as a guide to production and marketing should be encourage expenditure of public fund to bring in more new land should have most searching scrutiny so long as our farmer face unsatisfactory price for crop and livestock produce on land already under cultivation every proper effort should be make to put land to use for which it be adapt the reforestation of land well suit for timber production be progress and should be encourage and to this end the forest taxation inquiry be institute to afford a practical guide for public policy improvement bas be make in graze regulation in the forest reserve not only to protect the range but to preserve the soil from erosion similar action be urgently need to protect other public land which be now overgraze and rapidly erode temporary expedient though sometimes capable of appease the demand of the moment can not permanently solve the surplus problem and might seriously aggravate it hence put the government directly into business subsidy and price fixing and the alluring promise of political action as a substitute for private initiative should be avoid the government should aid in promote orderly marketing and in handle surplus clearly due to weather and seasonal condition as a beginning there should be create a federal farm board consist of able and experienced man empower to advise producer association in establish central agency or stabilization corporation to handle surplus to seek wear economical mean of merchandising and to aid the producer in secure return accord to the a14 of his product a revolving loan fund should be provide for the necessary financing until these agency shall have develop mean of finance their operation through regularly constitute credit institution such a bill should carry authority for raise the money by loan or otherwise necessary to meet the expense as the treasury have no surplus agriculture have lag behind industry in achieve that unity of effort which modern economic life demand the cooperative movement which be gradually build the need organization be in harmony with public interest and therefore merit public encouragement the responsibility of the state important phase of public policy relate to agriculture lie within the sphere of the states while successive reduction in federal taxis have relieve most farmer of direct taxis to the national government state and local levy have become a serious burden this problem need immediate and thorough study with a view to correction at the early possible moment it will have to be make largely by the states themselves commerce it be desirable that the government continue its helpful attitude toward american business the activity of the department of commerce have contribute largely to the present satisfactory position in our international trade which have reach about $ 9,000,000,000 annually there should be no slackening of effort in that direction it be also important that the department 's assistance to domestic commerce be continue there be probably no way in which the government can aid sound economic progress more effectively than by cooperation with our business man to reduce waste in distribution commercial aeronautics continue progress in civil aviation be most gratifying demand for airplane and motor have tax both the industry and the licensing and inspection service of the department of commerce to their capacity while the compulsory licensing provision of the air commerce act apply only to equipment and personnel engage in interstate and foreign commerce a federal license may be procure by anyone possess the necessary qualification state legislation local airport regulation and insurance requirement make such a license practically indispensable this result in uniformity of regulation and increase safety in operation which be essential to aeronautical development over 17,000 young man and woman have now apply for federal air pilot 's license or permit more than 80 per cent of they apply during the past year our national airway system exceed 14,000 mile in length and have 7,500 mile light for night operation provision have be make for lighting 4,000 mile more during the current fiscal year and equip an equal mileage with radio facility three quarter of our people be now serve by these route with the rapid growth of air mail express and passenger service this new transportation medium be daily become a more important factor in commerce it be noteworthy that this development have take place without governmental subsidy commercial passenger flight operate on schedule have reach 13,000 mile per day during the next fortnight this nation will entertain the nation of the world in a celebration of the twenty fifth anniversary of the first successful airplane flight the credit for this epoch make achievement belong to a citizen of our own country orville wright cuban parcel post i desire to repeat my recommendation of an early message that congress enact the legislation necessary to make permanent the parcel post convention with cuba both as a facility to american commerce and as a measure of equity to cuba in the one class of good which that country can send here by parcel post without detriment to our own trade "maine battleship memorial when i attend the pan american conference at habana the president of cuba show i a marble statue make from the original memorial that be overturn by a storm after it be erect on the cuban shore to the memory of the man who perish in the destruction of the battleship maine as a testimony of friendship and appreciation of the cuban government and people lie most generously offer to present this to the united states and i assure he of my pleasure in accept it there be no location in the white house for place so large and heavy a structure and i therefore urge the congress to provide by law for some locality where it can be set up railroads in previous annual message i have suggest the enactment of law to promote railroad consolidation with the view of increase the efficiency of transportation and lessen its cost to the public while consolidation can and should be make under the present law until it be change vet the provision of the act of 1920 have not be find fully adequate to meet the need of other method of consolidation amendment design to remedy these defect have be consider at length by the respective committee of congress and a bill be report out late in the last session which i understand have the approval in principle of the interstate commerce commission it be to be hope that this legislation may be enact at an early date experience have show that the interstate commerce law require definition and clarification in several other respect some of which have be point out by the interstate commerce commission in its annual report to the congress it will promote the public interest to have the congress give early consideration to the recommendation there make merchant marine the cost of maintain the united states government merchant fleet have be steadily reduce we have establish american flag line in foreign trade where they have never before exist as a means of promote commerce and as a naval auxiliary there have be sell to private american capital for operation within the past few year 14 of these line which under the encouragement of the recent legislation pass by the congress give promise of continue successful operation additional legislation from time to time may be necessary to promote future advancement under private control through the cooperation of the post office department and the shipping board long term contract be be make with american steamship line for carry mail which already promise the construction of 15 to 20 new vessel and the gradual reestablishment of the american merchant marine as a private enterprise no action of the national government have be so beneficial to our shipping the cost be be absorb to a considerable extent by the disposal of unprofitable line operate by the shipping board for which the new law have make a market meanwhile it should be our policy to maintain necessary strategic line under the government operation until they can be transfer to private capital inter american highway in my message last year i express the view that we should lend our encouragement for more good road to all the principal point on this hemisphere south of the rio grande my view have not change the pan american union have recently indorse it in some of the country to the south a great deal of progress be be make in road building in others engineering feature be often exact and finance difficult as those country enter upon program for road building we should be ready to contribute from our abundant experience to make their task easy of accomplishment i prefer not to go into civil life to accomplish this end we already furnish military and naval advisor and follow this precedent we could draw competent man from these same source and from the department of agriculture we should provide our southern neighbor if they request it with such engineer advisor for the construction of road and bridge private t1literest should look with favor upon all reasonable loan seek by these country to open main line of travel such assistance should be give especially to any project for a highway design to connect all the country on this hemisphere and thus facilitate intercourse and close relation among they air mail service the friendly relation and the extensive commercial intercourse with the western hemisphere to the south of we be be far cement by the establishment and extension of air mail route we shall soon have one from key west fla. over cuba haiti and santo domingo to san juan p. r. where it will connect with another route to trinidad there will be another route from key west to the canal zone where connection will be make with a route across the northern coast of south america to paramaribo this will give we a circle around the caribbean under our own control additional connection will be make at colon with a route run down the west coast of south america as far as conception chile and with the french air mail at paramaribo run down the eastern coast of south america the air service already span our continent with lateral run to mexico and canada and cover a daily flight of over 28,000 mile with an average cargo of 15 000 pound waterways our river and harbor improvement be proceed with vigor in the past few year ave have increase the appropriation for this regular work $ 28,000,000 besides what be to be expend on flood control the total appropriation for this year be over $ 91,000,000 the ohio river be almost ready for opening work on the missouri and other river be under way in accordance with the mississippi flood law army engineer be make investigation and survey on other stream throughout the country with a view to flood control navigation waterpow and irrigation our bar(re line be be operate under generous appropriation and negotiation be develop relative to the st. lawrence waterway to secure the large benefit from all these waterway joint rate must be establish with the railroad preferably by agreement but otherwise as a result of congressional action we have recently pass several river and harbor bill the work order by the congress not yet complete will cost about $ 243,000,000 besides the hundred of million to be spend on the mississippi flood way until we can see our way out of this expense no further river and harbor legislation should be pass as expenditure to put it into effect would be four or five year away irrigation of arid land for many year the federal government have be commit to the wise policy of reclamation and irrigation while it have meet with some failure due to unwise selection of project and lack of thorough soil survey so that they could not be place on a sound business basis on the whole the service have be of such incalculable benefit in so many states that no one would advocate its abandonment the program to which we be already commit provide for the construction of new project authorize by congress and the completion of old project will tax the resource of the reclamation fund over a period of year the high cost of improve and equip farm add to the difficulty of secure settler for vacant farm on federal project readjustment authorize by the reclamation relief act of may 25 1926 have give more favorable term of repayment to settler these new financial arrangement and the general prosperity on irrigation project have result in increase collection by the department of the interior of charge due the reclamation fund nevertheless the demand for still small yearly payment on some project continue these condition should have consideration in connection with any propose new project colorado river for several year the congress have consider the erection of a dam on the colorado river for flood control irrigation and domestic water purpose all of which ma properly be consider as government function there would be an incidental creation of water power which could be use for generate electricity as private enterprise can very well fill this field there be no need for the government to go into it it be unfortunate that the states interested in this water have be unable to agree among themselves nevertheless any legislation should give every possible safeguard to the present and prospective right of each of they the congress will have before it the detailed report of a special board appoint to consider the engineering and economic feasibility of this project from the short summary which i have see of it 11 judge they consider the engineering problem can be meet at somewhat increase cost over previous estimate they prefer the black canyon site on the economic feature they be not so clear and appear to base their conclusion on many condition which can not be establish with certainty so far as i can judge however from the summary their conclusion appear sufficiently favorable so that i feel warrant in recommend a measure which will protect the right of the states discharge the necessary government function and leave the electrical field to private enterprise muscle shoals the development of other method of produce nitrate will probably render this plant less important for that purpose than formerly but we have it and i be tell it still provide a practical method of make nitrate for national defense and farm fertilizer by divide the property into its two component part of power and nitrate plant it would be possible to dispose of the power reserve the right to any concern that wish to make nitrate to use any power that might be need for that purpose such a disposition of the power plant can be make that will return in rental about $ 2,000,000 per year if the congress would giant the secretary of war authority to lease the nitrate plant on such term as would insure the large production of nitrate the entire property could begin tofunction such a division i be aware have never seem to appeal to the congress i should also gladly approve a bill grant authority to lease the entire property for the production of nitrate i wish to avoid build another lam at public expense future operator should provide for that themselves but if they be to be require to repay the cost of such dam with tile prevail commercial rate for interest this difficulty will be considerably lessen nor do i think this property should be make a vehicle for put the united states government indiscriminately into the private and retail field of power distribution and nitrate sale conservation the practical application of economy to the resource of the country call for conservation this do not mean that every resource should not be develop to its full degree but it mean that none of they should be waste we have a conservation board work on our oil problem this be of the utmost importance to the future well being of our people in this age of oil burn engine and tile general application of gasoline to transportation the secretary of the interior should not be compel to lease oil land of the osage indians when the market be depressed and the future supply be in jeopardy while the area of land remain in public ownership be small compare with the vast area in private ownership the natural resource of those in public ownership be of immense present and future value this be particularly trite as to mineral and water power the proper bureau have be classify these resource to the end that they may be conserve appropriate estimate be be submit in the budget for the further prosecution of this important work immigration the policy of restrictive immigration should be maintain authority should be grant the secretary of labor to give immediate preference to learn profession and expert essential to new industry the reuniting of family should be expedite our immigration and naturalization law might well be codify wage earner in its economic life our country have reject the long accept law of a limitation of the wage fund which lead to pessimism and despair because it be the doctrine of perpetual poverty and have substitute for it the american conception that the only limit to profit and wage be production which be the doctrine of optimism and hope because it lead to prosperity here and there the council of labor be still darken by the theory that only by limit individual production can there be any assurance of permanent employment for increase number but in general management and wage earner alike have become emancipate from this doom and have enter a new era in industrial thought which have unleash the productive capacity of the individual worker with an increase scale of wage and profit the end of which be not yet the application of this theory account for our widen distribution of wealth no discovery ever do more to increase the happiness and prosperity of the people since 1922 increase production have increase wage in general 12.9 per cent while in certain select trade they have run as high as 34.9 per cent and 38 per cent even in the boot and shoe shop the increase be over 5 per cent and in woolen mill 8.4 per cent although these industry have not prosper like other as the rise in living cost in this period be negligible these figure represent real wage increase the cause of constructive economy require that the government should cooperate with private interest to eliminate the waste arise from industrial accident this item with all that have be do to reduce it still reach enormous proportion with great suffering to the workman and great loss to the country women and child the federal government should continue its solicitous care for the 8,500,000 woman wage earner and its effort in behalf of public health which be reduce infant mortality and improve the 91odily and mental condition of our citizen civil service the most marked change make in the civil service of the government in the past eight year relate to the increase in salary the board of actuaries on the retirement act show by its report that july 1 1921 the average salary of the 330,047 employee subject to the act be j1,307 while on june 30 1927 the average salary of the corresponding 405,263 be $ 1,969 this be an increase in six year of nearly 53 per cent on top of this be the generous increase make at the last session of the congress generally applicable to federal employee and another bill increase the pay in certain branch of the postal service beyond the large increase which be make three year ago this raise the average level from $ 1,969 to $ 2,092 make an increase in seven year of over 63 per cent while it be well know that in the upper bracket the pay in the federalservice be much small than in private employment in the low bracket range well up over $ 3,000 it be much high it be high not only in actual money pay but in privilege grant a vacation of 30 actual working day or 5 week each year with additional time run in some department as high as 30 day for sick leave and the generous provision of the retirement act no other body of public servant ever occupy such a fortunate position education through the bureau of education of the department of the interior the federal

philippine island under the guidance of governor general stimson the economic and political condition of the philippine islands have be raise to a standard never before surpass the cooperation between his administration and the people of the island be complete and harmonious it would be an advantage if relief from double taxation could be grant by the congress to our citizen do business in the

be be retrieve sugar tobacco citrus fruit and coffee all suffer damage the first three can largely look after themselves the coffee grower will need some assistance which should be extend strictly on a business basis and only after most careful investigation the people of porto rico be not ask for charity department of justice it be desirable that all the legal activity of the government be consolidate under the supervision of the attorney general in1870 it be feel necessary to create the department of justice for this purpose during the intervene period either through legislation create law officer or departmental action additional legal position not under the supervision of the attorney general have be provide until there be now over 900 such a condition be as harmful to the interest of the government now as it be in 1870 and should be correct by appropriate legislation special government counsel in order to prosecute the oil case i suggest and the congress enact a law provide for the appointment of two special counsel they have pursue their work with signal ability recover all the lease land besides nearly $ 30,000,000 in money and nearly $ 17,000,000 in other

compel to resign no good result be secure by the application of this rule to these counsel and as mr. roberts have consent to take reappointment if the rule be abrogate i recommend the passage of an amendment to the law create their office exempt they from the general rule against take other case involve the government prohibition the country have duly adopt the eighteenth amendment those who object to it have the right to advocate its modification or repeal meantime it be bind upon the national and state governments and all our inhabitant the federal enforcement bureau be make every effort to prevent violation especially through smuggling manufacture and transportation and to prosecute generally all violation for which it can secure evidence it be bind to continue this policy under the term of the constitution however the obligation be equally on the states to exercise the power which they have through the executive legislative judicial and police branch of their government in behalf of enforcement the federal government be do and will continue to do all it can in this direction and be entitle to7the active cooperation of the states conclusion the country be in the midst of an era of prosperity more extensive and of peace more permanent than it have ever before experience but having reach this position we should not fail to comprehend that it can easily be lose it need more effort for its support than the less exalted place of the world we shall not be permit to take our case but shall continue to be require to spend our day in unremitte toil the action of the government must command the confidence of the country without this our prosperity would be lose we must extend to other country the large measure of generosity moderation and patience in addition to deal justly we can well afford to walk humbly the end of government be to keep open the opportunity for a moreabundant life peace and prosperity be not finality they be only method it be too easy under their influence for a nation to become selfish and degenerate this test have come to the united states our country have be provide with the resource with which it can enlarge its intellectual moral and spiritual life the issue be in the hand of the people our faith in man and god be the justification for the belief in our continue success
my countrymen

 this occasion be not alone the administration of the most sacred oath which can be assume by an american citizen it be a dedication and consecration under god to the high office in service of our people i assume this trust in the humility of knowledge that only through the guidance of almighty providence can i hope to discharge its ever increase burden

 it be in keep with tradition throughout our history that i should express simply and directly the opinion which i hold concern some of the matter of present importance

 our progress

 if we survey the situation of our nation both at home and abroad we find many satisfaction we find some cause for concern we have emerge from the loss of the great war and the reconstruction follow it within creased virility and strength from this strength we have contribute to the recovery and progress of the world what america have do have give renew hope and courage to all who have faith in government by the people in the large view we have reach a high degree of comfort and security than ever exist before in the history of the world through liberation from widespread poverty we have reach a high degree of individual freedom than ever before the devotion to and concern for our institution be deep and sincere we be steadily build a new race a new civilization great in its own attainment the influence and high purpose of our nation be respect among the people of the world we aspire to distinction in the world but to a distinction base upon confidence in our sense of justice as well as our accomplishment within our own border and in our own life for wise guidance in this great period of recovery the nation be deeply indebted to calvin coolidge

 but all this majestic advance should not obscure the constant danger from which self government must be safeguard the strong man must at all time be alert to the attack of insidious disease

 the failure of our system of criminal justice

 the most malign of all these danger today be disregard and disobedience of law crime be increase confidence in rigid and speedy justice be decrease i be not prepared to believe that this indicate any decay in the moral fiber of the american people i be not prepared to believe that it indicate an impotence of the federal government to enforce its law

 it be only in part due to the additional burden impose upon our judicial system by the eighteenth amendment the problem be much wide than that many influence have increasingly complicate and weaken our law enforcement organization long before the adoption of the eighteenth amendment

 to reestablish the vigor and effectiveness of law enforcement we must critically consider the entire federal machinery of justice the redistribution of its function the simplification of its procedure the provision of additional special tribunal the well selection of jury and the more effective organization of our agency of investigation and prosecution that justice may be sure and that it may be swift while the authority of the federal government extend to but part of our vast system of national state and local justice yet the standard which the federal government establishe have the most profound influence upon the whole structure

 we be fortunate in the ability and integrity of our federal judge and attorney but the system which these officer be call upon to administer be in many respect ill adapt to present day condition its intricate and involved rule of procedure have become the refuge of both big and little criminal there be a belief abroad that by invoke technicality subterfuge and delay the end of justice may be thwart by those who can pay the cost

 reform reorganization and strengthening of our whole judicial and enforcement system both in civil and criminal side have be advocate for year by statesman judge and bar association first step toward that end should not long be delay rigid and expeditious justice be the first safeguard of freedom the basis of all order liberty the vital force of progress it must not come to be in our republic that it can be defeat by the indifference of the citizen by exploitation of the delay and entanglement of the law or by combination of criminal justice must not fail because the agency of enforcement be either delinquent or inefficiently organize to consider these evil to find their remedy be the most sore necessity of our time

 enforcement of the eighteenth amendment

 of the undoubted abuse which have grow up under the eighteenth amendment part be due to the cause i have just mention but part be due to the failure of some states to accept their share of responsibility for concurrent enforcement and to the failure of many state and local official to accept the obligation under their oath of office zealously to enforce the law with the failure from these many cause have come a dangerous expansion in the criminal element who have find enlarge opportunity in deal in illegal liquor

 but a large responsibility rest directly upon our citizen there would be little traffic in illegal liquor if only criminal patronize it we must awake to the fact that this patronage from large number of law abide citizen be supply the reward and stimulate crime

 i have be select by you to execute and enforce the law of the country i propose to do so to the extent of my own ability but the measure of success that the government shall attain will depend upon the moral support which you as citizen extend the duty of citizen to support the law of the land be coequal with the duty of their government to enforce the law which exist no great national service can be give by man and woman of good will who i know be not unmindful of the responsibility of citizenship than that they should by their example assist in stamp out crime and outlawry by refuse participation in and condemn all transaction with illegal liquor our whole system of self government will crumble either if official elect what law they will enforce or citizen select what law they will support the bad evil of disregard for some law be that it destroy respect for all law for our citizen to patronize the violation of a particular law on the ground that they be oppose to it be destructive of the very basis of all that protection of life of home and property which they rightly claim under other law if citizen do not like a law their duty as honest man and woman be to discourage its violation their right be openly to work for its repeal

 to those of criminal mind there can be no appeal but vigorous enforcement of the law fortunately they be but a small percentage of our people their activity must be stop

 a national investigation

 i propose to appoint a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure of our federal system of jurisprudence to include the method of enforcement of the eighteenth amendment and the cause of abuse under it its purpose will be to make such recommendation for reorganization of the administration of federal law and court procedure as may be find desirable in the meantime it be essential that a large part of the enforcement activity be transfer from the treasury department to the department of justice as a beginning of more effective organization

 the relation of government to business

 the election have again confirm the determination of the american people that regulation of private enterprise and not government ownership or operation be the course rightly to be pursue in our relation to business in recent year we have establish a differentiation in the whole method of business regulation between the industry which produce and distribute commodity on the one hand and public utility on the other in the former our law insist upon effective competition in the latter because we substantially confer a monopoly by limit competition we must regulate their service and rate the rigid enforcement of the law applicable to both group be the very base of equal opportunity and freedom from domination for all our people and it be just as essential for the stability and prosperity of business itself as for the protection of the public at large such regulation should be extend by the federal government within the limitation of the constitution and only when the individual state be without power to protect their citizen through their own authority on the other hand we should be fearless when the authority rest only in the federal government

 cooperation by the government

 the large purpose of our economic thought should be to establish more firmly stability and security of business and employment and thereby remove poverty still far from our border our people have in recent year develop a new find capacity for cooperation among themselves to effect high purpose in public welfare it be an advance toward the high conception of self- government self government do not and should not imply the use of political agency alone progress be bear of cooperation in the community not from governmental restraint the government should assist and encourage these movement of collective self- help by itself cooperate with they business have by cooperation make great progress in the advancement of service in stability in regularity of employment and in the correction of its own abuse such progress however can continue only so long as business manifest its respect for law

 there be an equally important field of cooperation by the federal government with the multitude of agency state municipal and private in the systematic development of those process which directly affect public health recreation education and the home we have need far to perfect the mean by which government can be adapt to human service

 education

 although education be primarily a responsibility of the states and local community and rightly so yet the nation as a whole be vitally concerned in its development everywhere to the high standard and to complete universality self government can succeed only through an instructed electorate our objective be not simply to overcome illiteracy the nation have march far beyond that the more complex the problem of the nation become the great be the need for more and more advanced instruction moreover as our number increase and as our life expand with science and invention we must discover more and more leader for every walk of life we can not hope to succeed in direct this increasingly complex civilization unless we can draw all the talent of leadership from the whole people one civilization after another have be wreck upon the attempt to secure sufficient leadership from a single group or class if we would prevent the growth of class distinction and would constantly refresh our leadership with the ideal of our people we must draw constantly from the general mass the full opportunity for every boy and girl to rise through the selective process of education can alone secure to we this leadership

 public health

 in public health the discovery of science have open a new era many section of our country and many group of our citizen suffer from disease the eradication of which be mere matter of administration and moderate expenditure public health service should be as fully organize and as universally incorporate into our governmental system as be public education the return be a thousand fold in economic benefit and infinitely more in reduction of suffering and promotion of human happiness

 world peace

 the united states fully accept the profound truth that our own progress prosperity and peace be interlock with the progress prosperity and peace of all humanity the whole world be at peace the danger to a continuation of this peace today be largely the fear and suspicion which still haunt the world no suspicion or fear can be rightly direct toward our country

 those who have a true understanding of america know that we have no desire for territorial expansion for economic or other domination of other people such purpose be repugnant to our ideal of human freedom our form of government be ill adapt to the responsibility which inevitably follow permanent limitation of the independence of other people superficial observer seem to find no destiny for our abound increase in population in wealth and power except that of imperialism they fail to see that theamerican people be engross in the building for themselves of a new economic system a new social system a new political system all of which be characterize by aspiration of freedom of opportunity and thereby be the negation of imperialism they fail to realize that because of our abound prosperity our youth be press more and more into our institution of learning;that our people be seek a large vision through art literature science and travel that they be move toward strong moral and spiritual life that from these thing our sympathy be broaden beyond the bound of our nation and race toward their true expression in a real brotherhood of man they fail to see that the idealism of america will lead it to no narrow or selfish channel but inspire it to do its full share as a nation toward the advancement of civilization it will do that not by mere declaration but by take a practical part in support all useful international undertaking we not only desire peace with the world but to see peace maintain throughout the world we wish to advance the reign of justice and reason toward the extinction of force

 the recent treaty for the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy set an advanced standard in our conception of the relation of nation its acceptance should pave the way to great limitation of armament the offer of which we sincerely extend to the world but its full realization also imply a great and great perfection in the instrumentality for pacific settlement of controversy between nation in the creation and use of these instrumentality we should support every sound method of conciliation arbitration and judicial settlement american statesman be among the first to propose and they have constantly urge upon the world the establishment of a tribunal for the settlement of controversy of a justiciable character the permanent court of international justice in its major purpose be thus peculiarly identify with american ideal and with american statesmanship no more potent instrumentality for this purpose have ever be conceive and no other be practicable of establishment the reservation place upon our adherence should not be misinterpret the united states seek by these reservation no special privilege or advantage but only to clarify our relation to advisory opinion and other matter which be subsidiary to the major purpose of the court the way should and i believe will be find by which we may take our proper place in a movement so fundamental to the progress of peace

 our people have determine that we should make no political engagement such as membership in the league of nations which may commit we in advance as a nation to become involved in the settlement of controversy between other country they adhere to the belief that the independence of america from such obligation increase its ability and availability for service in all field of human progress

 i have lately return from a journey among our sister republics of the western hemisphere i have receive unbounded hospitality and courtesy as their expression of friendliness to our country we be hold by particular bond of sympathy and common interest with they they be each of they build a racial character and a culture which be an impressive contribution to human progress we wish only for the maintenance of their independence the growth of their stability and their prosperity while we have have war in the western hemisphere yet on the whole the record be in encourage contrast with that of other part of the world fortunately the new world be largely free from the inheritance of fear and distrust which have so trouble the old world we should keep it so

 it be impossible my countryman to speak of peace without profound emotion in thousand of home in america in million of home around the world there be vacant chair it would be a shameful confession of our unworthiness if it should develop that we have abandon the hope for which all these man die surely civilization be old enough surely mankind be mature enough so that we ought in our own lifetime to find a way to permanent peace abroad to west and east be nation whose son mingle their blood with the blood of our son on the battlefield most of these nation have contribute to our race to our culture our knowledge and our progress from one of they we derive our very language and from many of they much of the genius of our institution their desire for peace be as deep and sincere as our own

 peace can be contribute to by respect for our ability in defense peace can be promote by the limitation of arm and by the creation of the instrumentality for peaceful settlement of controversy but it will become a reality only through self- restraint and active effort in friendliness and helpfulness i covet for this administration a record of having far contribute to advance the cause of peace

 party responsibility

 in our form of democracy the expression of the popular will can be effect only through the instrumentality of political party we maintain party government not to promote intolerant partisanship but because opportunity must be give for expression of the popular will and organization provide for the execution of its mandate and for accountability of government to the people it follow that the government both in the executive and the legislative branch must carry out in good faith the platform upon which the party be entrust with power but the government be that of the whole people the party be the instrument through which policy be determined and man choose to bring they into be the animosity of election should have no place in our government for government must concern itself alone with the common weal

 special session of the congress

 action upon some of the proposal upon which the republican party be return to power particularly further agricultural relief and limited change in the tariff can not in justice to our farmer our labor and our manufacturer be postpone i shall therefore request a special session of congress for the consideration of these two question i shall deal with each of they upon the assembly of the congress

 other mandate from the election

 it appear to i that the more important further mandate from the recent election be the maintenance of the integrity of the constitution the vigorous enforcement of the law the continuance of economy in public expenditure the continue regulation of business to prevent domination in the community the denial of ownership or operation of business by thegovernment in competition with its citizen the avoidance of policy which would involve we in the controversy of foreign nation the more effective reorganization of the department of the federal government the expansion of public work and the promotion of welfare activity affect education and the home

 these be the more tangible determination of the election but beyond they be the confidence and belief of the people that we would not neglect the support of the embed ideal and aspiration of america these ideal and aspiration be the touchstone upon which the day to day administration and legislative act of government must be test more than this the government must so far as lie within its proper power give leadership to the realization of these ideal and to the fruition of these aspiration no one can adequately reduce these thing of the spirit to phrase or to a catalogue of definition we do know what the attainment of these ideal should be the preservation of self government and its full foundation in local government the perfection of justice whether in economic or in social field the maintenance of order liberty the denial of domination by any group or class the building up and preservation of equality of opportunity the stimulation of initiative and individuality absolute integrity in public affair the choice of official for fitness to office;the direction of economic progress toward prosperity for the further lessening of poverty the freedom of public opinion the sustaining of education and of the advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit and the tolerance of all faith the strengthening of the home the advancement of peace

 there be no short road to the realization of these aspiration ours be a progressive people but with a determination that progress must be base upon the foundation of experience ill- consider remedy for our fault bring only penalty after they but if we hold the faith of the man in our mighty past who create these ideal we shall leave they heighten and strengthen for our child

 conclusion

 this be not the time and place for extended discussion the question before our country be problem of progress to high standard they be not the problem of degeneration they demand thought and they serve to quicken the conscience and enlist our sense of responsibility for their settlement and that responsibility rest upon you my countryman as much as upon those of we who have be select for office

 ours be a land rich in resource stimulate in its glorious beauty;filled with million of happy home bless with comfort and opportunity in no nation be the institution of progress more advanced in no nation be the fruit of accomplishment more secure in no nation be the government more worthy of respect no country be more love by its people i have an abide faith in their capacity integrity and high purpose i have no fear for the future of our country it be bright with hope

 in the presence of my countryman mindful of the solemnity of this occasion know what the task mean and the responsibility which it involve i beg your tolerance your aid and your cooperation i ask the help of almightygod in this service to my country to which you have call i
the vote in the senate today at well add further delay to farm relief and may gravely jeopardize the enactment of legislation in reject the report of the senate and house conferee which report be agree to by member of both party the senate have in effect reject a bill which provide for the creation of the most important agency ever set up in the government to assist an industry the propose federal farm board endow with extraordinary authority to reorganize the marketing system in the interest of the farmer to stabilize his industry and to carry out these arrangement in conjunction with farm cooperative with a capital of $ 500 million as an earnest of the seriousness of the work it be a proposal for steady upbuilding of agriculture onto firm foundation of equality with other industry and would remove the agricultural problem from politic and place it in the realm of business
 the conferee bill carry out the plan advance in the campaign in every particular every other plan of agricultural relief be reject in that campaign and this plan be one of the most important issue in the principal agricultural states and be give as a mandate by an impressive majority in these states subsidy be condemn in the course of the campaign and the so call debenture plan that be the giving of subsidy on export be not raise by either party nor by its proponent
 no serious attempt have be make to meet the many practical objection i and leader in congress have advance against this proposal it p.184 be not accept by the house of representatives and have be overwhelmingly condemn by the press and be oppose by many lead farm organization for no matter what the theory of the export subsidy may be in the practical world we live in it will not bring equality but will bring further disparity to agriculture it will bring immediate profit to some speculator and disaster to the farmer
 i earnestly hope that the congress will enact the conferee report and allow we to enter upon the building of a sound agricultural system rather than to long deprive the farmer of the relief which he sorely need

my countryman and woman of the radio audience
 of the untold value of the radio one be the great intimacy it have bring among our people through its mysterious channel we come to wide acquaintance with surrounding and man
 the microphone for these few moment have be bring to the president&#39;s study in the east wing of the white house
 this room from which i speak be the scene of work and accomplishment of our president for over a century into this room first come john adams who have take over the rein of administration of the newly establish republic from george washington each president in the long procession of year down to roosevelt work at this fireside in the refurnishing of the white house by mr. roosevelt the president&#39;s study be move to another room which be use by our president from mr. taft to mr. coolidge but recent extension to the white house make it possible for i to restore the president&#39;s study to this room where still linger the invisible presence of so many of our great man
 it be here where the adamses father and son jefferson monroe jackson grant mckinley roosevelt and a score of other devoted man work here work lincoln in this room he sign the emancipation of the negro race from slavery it be a room crowd with memory of the courage and the high aspiration and the high accomplishment of p.295 the american presidents it be a room in which have be mark many of our national triumph
 the problem of our country today crowd for entry here as they have each day for more than 130 year past one problem have be ever constant with each succeed president that we should maintain and strengthen the will of the nation and other nation for peace in this room have be take those reluctant step which have lead our nation to war and those willing step which have again lead to peace never have we have a president who be either a pacifist or a militarist never have there be a president who do not pray that his administration might be one of peace and that peace should be more assured for his successor yet these man have never hesitate when war become the duty of the nation and always in these year the thought of our president have be adequate preparedness for defense as one of the assurance of peace but that preparedness must not exceed the bare necessity for defense or it become a threat of aggression against other and thus a cause of fear and animosity of the world
 and there be other assurance of peace which have be devise in this room advanced and support by our president over the past half century great aid have be give by they to the advance of conciliation arbitration and judicial determination for settlement of international dispute these be the step which prevent war lately we and other nation have pledge ourselves never to use war as an instrument of national policy and there be another such step which follow with impel logic from those advance that be the reduction of arm
 some month ago i propose to the world that we should far reduce and limit naval arm today we be engage in a most hopeful discussion with other government lead to this end these be proposal which would preserve our national defense and yet would relieve the back of those who toil from gigantic expenditure and the world from the hate and fear which flow from the rivalry in building warship and daily in this room do i receive evidence of almost universal prayer that this negotiation shall succeed for confidence that there will be peace be the first necessity of human progress
in reply to press question as to the business situation the president say
 the fundamental business of the country that be the production and distribution of commodity be on a sound and prosperous basis the good evidence be that although production and consumption be at high level the average price of commodity as a whole have not increase and there have be no appreciable increase in the stock of manufacture good moreover there have be a tendency of wage to increase the output per worker in many industry again show an increase all of which indicate a healthy condition
 the construction and building material industry have be to some extent affect by the high interest rate induce by stock speculation and there have be some seasonal decrease in one or two other industry but these movement be of secondary character when consider in the whole situation
 a temporary drop in grain price sympathetically with stock exchange price usually happen but as the department of agriculture point out the overriding fact in grain be that this year&#39;s world wheat harvest be estimate to be 500 million bushel less than that of last year which will result in a very low carryover at the end of the harvest year

the national economic condition
 the president i haven&#39;t anything of any news here to announce
 i think perhaps you might like that i discuss the business situation with you just a little but not from the point of view of publication at all simply for your own information i see no particular reason for make any public statement about it either directly or indirectly
 the question be one somewhat of analysis we have have a period of over speculation that have be extremely widespread one of those wave of speculation that be more or less uncontrollable as evidence by the effort of the federal reserve board and that ultimately result in a crash due to its own weight that crash be perhaps a little expedite by the foreign situation in that one result of this whole phenomenon have be the congestion of capital in the loan market in new york in the driving up of money rate all over the world
 the foreign central bank having determine that they would bring the crisis to an end at least so far as their own country be concern p.367 advanced money rate very rapidly in practically every european country in order to attract capital that have drift from europe into new york back into their own industry and commerce incidentally the effect of increase discount rate in europe be much great on their business structure than it be with we our business structure be not so sensitive to interest rate as theirs be so their sharp advancement of discount rate tend to affect this market and probably expedite or even start this movement but once the movement have take place we have a number of phenomenon that rapidly develop the first be that the domestic bank in the interior of the united states and corporation withdraw their money from the call market
 there have be a very great movement out of new york into the interior of the united states as well as some movement out of new york into foreign country the incidental result of that be to create a difficult situation in new york but also to increase the available capital in the interior in the interior there have be in consequence a tendency for interest rate to fall at once because of the unemployed capital bring back into interior point
 perhaps the situation might be clear on account of its parallel with the last very great crisis 1907 1908 in that crash the same drain of money immediately take place into the interior in that case there be no federal reserve system there be no way to acquaint of capital movement over the country and the interest rate run up to 300 percent the result be to bring about a monetary panic in the entire country
 here with the federal reserve system and the activity of the board and the ability with which the situation have be handle there have be a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the rest of the business phenomenon in the country the board in cooperation with the bank in new york have make ample capital available for the call market in substitution of the withdrawal this have result in a general fall of interest rate not only in the interior but also in new york as witness the reduction of the discount rate so that instead of have a panic rise in interest rate with monetary rise follow it we have exactly the reverse phenomenon we have a fall interest p.368 rate that be the normal thing to happen when capital be withdraw from the call market through diminution in value
 the ultimate result of it be a complete isolation of the stock market phenomenon from the general business phenomenon in other word the financial world be function entirely normal and rather more easily today than it be 2 week ago because interest rate be less and there be more capital available
 the effect on production be purely psychological so far there might be say to be from such a shock some tendency on the part of people through alarm to decrease their activity but there have be no cancellation of any order whatsoever there have be some lessening of buy in some of the luxury contract but that be not a phenomenon itself
 the ultimate result of the normal course of thing would be that with a large release of capital from the speculative market there will be more capital available for the bond and mortgage market that market have be practically starve for the last 4 or 5 month there have be practically no or very little at least of mortgage or bond money available practically no bond issue of any consequence one result have be to create considerable reserve of business a number of states have not be able to place their bond for construction a number of municipality with bond issue have be hold up because of the inability to put they out at what they consider fair rate there be a great number of business concern that would proceed with their activity in expansion through mortgage and bond money which have have to delay all of which comprise a very substantial reserve in the country at the present time the normal result will be for the mortgage and bond market to spring up again and those reserve to come in with increase activity
 the sum of it be therefore that we have go through a crisis in the stock market but for the first time in history the crisis have be isolate to the stock market itself it have not extend into either the production activity of the country or the financial fabric of the country and for that i think we may give the major credit to the constitution of the federal reserve system
 and that be about a summary of the whole situation as it stand at this moment


 the economy and public confidence
 we be deal here with a psychological situation to a very considerable degree it be a question of fear we have have a collapse in the stock market out of which a good many people have lose money and a lot of people who could not afford to and a lot of unfortunate people have be bring in the effect of which in the american mind create an undue state of alarm because our national thinking naturally go back to previous occasion when event of that character have have a very considerable bearing upon the business situation and in its final interpretation it be employment
 now a great many people lift their standard of living and naturally the effect of such a thing tend to decrease consumption particularly for luxury and semi luxury and those trade be no doubt still affect
 but this occasion so far differ from all other in that the credit situation in the country be entirely isolate from it due to the federal reserve and the bank and there be no credit consideration involve but the natural recovery of increase interest rate by the withdrawal of capital from speculative security take that capital ultimately back into industry and commerce it be ordinarily the tendency of industrial leader and everyone else to sit back to see what happen and to be a little more cautious in his business than he might otherwise have be that we have to deal with
 we have also to deal naturally with some unemployment in the semi necessity trade but the real problem and the interpretation of it be one of maintenance of employment this be not a question of bolster stock market or stock price or anything of that kind we be deal with the vital question of maintain employment in the united states and consequently the comfort and standard of living of the people and their ability to buy good and proceed in the normal course of their life so that the purpose of this movement be to disabuse the public mind of the notion that there have be any serious or vital interruption in our economic system and that it be go to proceed in the ordinary normal manner and to get that impression over not by preachment and talk but by definite and positive act on the part of industry and business and p.388 the government and other as i say before i do not believe that word ever convince a discouraged person in these situation the thing that bring he back be courage and the natural sight of other industry and other man go ahead with their program and business
 so i want you to get that background upon it all because it seriously concern the press to give the confidence to the public that the business fabric be now organize itself take step on its own responsibility to carry on that it be go to go even far and stretch itself to meet any possible condition of employment be the thing that will give courage to the public rather than to say to they every day that they should not be alarm so that i be try to get this problem across by action in different industry and other group rather than by too much talking and therefore i don&#39;t want to talk about it i want the action to speak for itself these conclusion be not a statement from i that be the conclusion of those man who be present

to the senate and house of representatives
 the constitution require that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union and recommend to their consideration such measure as he shall judge necessary and expedient in comply with that requirement i wish to emphasize that during the past year the nation have continue to grow in strength our people have advance in comfort we have gain in knowledge the education of youth have be more widely spread moral and spiritual force have be maintain peace have become more assured the problem with which we be confront be the problem of growth and of progress in their solution we have to determine the fact to develop the relative importance to be assign to such fact to formulate a common judgment upon they and to realize solution in spirit of conciliation

 in the hope of reduce friction in the world and with the desire that we may reduce the great economic burden of naval armament we have join in conference with great britain france italy and japan to be hold in london in january to consider the further limitation and reduction of naval arm we hold high hope that success may attend this effort
 at the beginning of the present administration the neighboring state of mexico be good with domestic insurrection we maintain the embargo upon the shipment of arm to mexico but permit the duly constitute government to procure supply from our surplus war stock fortunately the mexican government by its own strength successfully withstand the insurrection with but slight damage opportunity of further peaceful development be give to that country at the request of the mexican government we have since lift the embargo on shipment of arm altogether the two government have take further step to promote friendly relationship and so solve our difference convention prolong for a period of two year the life of the general and special claim commission have be conclude
 in south america we be proud to have have part in the settlement of the long stand dispute between chile and peru in the disposal of the question of tacna arica

 this government have continue its effort to act as a mediator in boundary difficulty between guatemala and honduras
 a further instance of profound importance in establish good will be the inauguration of regular air mail service between the united states and caribbean central american and south american country
 we still have marine on foreign soil in nicaragua haiti and china in the large sense we do not wish to be represent abroad in such manner about 1,600 marine remain in nicaragua at the urgent request of that government and the leader of all party pende the training of a domestic constabulary capable of insure tranquility we have already reduce these force materially and we be anxious to withdraw they far as the situation warrant in haiti we have about 700 marine but it be a much more difficult problem the solution of which be still obscure if congress approve i shall dispatch a commission to haiti to review and study the matter in an endeavor to arrive at some more definite policy than at present our force in china constitute 2,605 man which we hope also far to reduce to the normal legation guard
 it be my desire to establish more firmly our understanding and relationship with the latin american country by strengthen the diplomatic mission to those country it be my hope to secure man long experience in our diplomatic service who speak the language of the people to whom they be accredit as chief of our diplomatic mission in these states i shall send to the senate at an early date the nomination of several such man
 the congress have by numerous wise and foresighted act in the past few year greatly strengthen the character of our representation abroad it have make liberal provision for the establishment of suitable quarter for our foreign staff in the different country in order however that we may far develop the most effective force in this one of the most responsible function of our government i shall recommend to the congress more liberal appropriation for the work of the state department i know of no expenditure of public money from which a great economic and moral return can come to we than by assure the most effective conduct of our foreign relation
 national defense
 to preserve internal order and freedom from encroachment be the first purpose of government our army and navy be be maintain in a most efficient state under officer of high intelligence and zeal the extent and expansion of their number and equipment as at present authorize be ample for this purpose
 we can well be deeply concern however at the grow expense from a total expenditure for national defense purpose in 1914 of $ 267,000,000 it naturally rise with the great war but recede again to $ 612,000,000 in 1924 when again it begin to rise until during the current fiscal year the expenditure will reach to over $ 730,000,000 exclude all civilian service of those department program now authorize will carry it to still large figure in future year while the remuneration pay to our soldier and sailor be justly at a high rate than that of any other country in the world and while the cost of subsistence be high yet the total of our expenditure be in excess of those of the most highly militarize nation of the world
 upon the conference shortly to be hold in london will depend such moderation as we can make in naval expenditure if we shall be compel to undertake the naval construction imply in the washington arm treaty as well as other construction which would appear to be necessary if no international agreement can be complete we shall be commit during the next six year to a construction expenditure of upward of $ 1,200,000,000 besides the necessary further increase in cost for annual upkeep
 after 1914 the various army contingent necessarily expand to the end of the great war and then recede to the low point in 1924 when expansion again begin in 1914 the officer and man in our regular force both army and navy be about 164,000 in 1924 there be about 256,000 and in 1929 there be about 250,000 our citizens&#39 army however include the national guard and other form of reserve increase these total up to about 299,000 in 1914 about 672,000 in 1924 and about 728,000 in 1929
 under the kellogg pact we have undertake never to use war as an instrument of national policy we have therefore undertake by covenant to use these equipment solely for defensive purpose from a defense point of view our force should be proportion to national need and should therefore to some extent be modify by the prospect of peace which be never bright than to day
 it should be bear in mind that the improvement in the national guard by federal support begin in 1920 have definitely strengthen our national security by render they far more effective than ever heretofore the advance of aviation have also greatly increase our effectiveness in defense in addition to the very large program of air force which we be maintain in the army and navy there have be an enormous growth of commercial aviation this have provide unanticipated reserve in manufacturing capacity and in industrial and air personnel which again add to our security
 i recommend that congress give earnest consideration to the possibility of prudent action which will give relief from our continuously mount expenditure
 finance of the government
 the finance of the government be in sound condition i shall submit the detailed evidence and the usual recommendation in the special budget message i may however summarize our position the public debt on june 30 this year stand at $ 16,931,000,000 compare to the maximum in august 1919 of $ 26,596,000,000 since june 30 it have be reduce by a further $ 238,000,000 in the budget to be submit the total appropriation recommend for the fiscal year 1931 be $ 3,830,445,231 as compare to $ 3,976,141,651 for the present fiscal year the present fiscal year however include $ 150,000,000 for the federal farm board as to which no estimate can as yet be determine for 1931
 owe to the many necessary burden assume by congress in previous year which now require large outlay it be with extreme difficulty that we shall be able to keep the expenditure for the next fiscal year within the bound of the present year economy in many direction have permit some accommodation of press need the net result be an increase as show above of about one tenth of 1 per cent above the present fiscal year we can not fail to recognize the obligation of the government in support of the public welfare but we must coincidentally bear in mind the burden of taxis and strive to find relief through some tax reduction every dollar so return fertilize the soil of prosperity
 tax reduction
 the estimate submit to i by the secretary of the treasury and the budget director indicate that the government will close the fiscal year 1930 with a surplus of about $ 225,000,000 and the fiscal year 1931 with a surplus of about $ 123,000,000 owe to unusual circumstance it have be extremely difficult to estimate future revenue with accuracy
 i believe however that the congress will be fully justify in give the benefit of the prospective surplus to the taxpayer particularly as ample provision for debt reduction have be make in both year through the form of debt retirement from ordinary revenue in view of the uncertainty in respect of future revenue and the comparatively small size of the indicate surplus in 1931 relief should take the form of a provisional revision of tax rate
 i recommend that the normal income tax rate applicable to the income of individual for the calendar year 1929 be reduce from 5 3 and 1 frac12 per cent to 4 2 and frac12 per cent and that the tax on the income of corporation for the calendar year 1929 be reduce from 12 to 11 per cent it be estimate that this will result in a reduction of $ 160,000,000 in income taxis to be collect during the calendar year 1930 the loss in revenue will be divide approximately equally between the fiscal year 1930 and 1931 such a program will give a measure of tax relief to the maximum number of taxpayer with relatively large benefit to taxpayer with small or moderate income
 foreign debt
 the past year have bring we near to completion of settlement of the indebtedness of foreign government to the united states
 the act of congress approve february 4 1929 authorize the settlement with the government of austria along line similar to the term of settlement offer by that government to its other relief creditor no agreement have yet be conclude with that government but the form of agreement have be settle and its execution only await the government of austria secure the assent by all the other relief creditor of the term offer the act of congress approve february 14 1929 authorize the settlement with the government of greece and an agreement be conclude on may 10 1929
 the government of france ratify the agreement with we on july 27 1929 this agreement will shortly be before the congress and i recommend its approval
 the only indebtedness of foreign government to the united states now unsettle be that of russia and armenia
 during the past year a committee of distinguished expert under american leadership submit a plan look to a revision of claim against germany by the various government the united states deny itself any participation in the war settlement of general reparation and our claim be comparatively small in amount they arise from cost of the army of occupation and claim of our private citizen for loss under award from the mixed claims commission establish under agreement with the german government in find a basis for settlement it be necessary for the committee of expert to request all the government concerned to make some contribution to the adjustment and we have feel that we should share a proportion of the concession make
 the state and treasury departments will be in a position shortly to submit for your consideration a draft of an agreement to be execute between the united states and germany provide for the payment of these revise amount a more extensive statement will be submit at that time
 the total amount of indebtedness of the various country to the united states now fund be $ 11,579,465,885 this sum be in effect provide by the issue of united states government bond to our own people the payment of the various government to we on account of principal and interest for 1930 be estimate at a total of about $ 239,000,000 for 1931 at about $ 236,000,000 for 1932 at about $ 246,000,000 the measure of american compromise in these settlement may be appreciate from the fact that our taxpayer be call upon to find annually about $ 475,000,000 in interest and in addition to redeem the principal of sum borrow by the united states government for these purpose
 alien enemy property
 the wise determination that this property seize in war should be return to its owner have proceed with considerable rapidity of the original seize cash and property value at a total of about $ 625,000,000 all but $ 111,566,700 have be return most of the remainder should be dispose of during the next year
 general economic situation
 the country have enjoy a large degree of prosperity and sound progress during the past year with a steady improvement in method of production and distribution and consequent advancement in standard of living progress have of course be unequal among industry and some such as coal lumber leather and textile still lag behind the long upward trend of fundamental progress however give rise to over optimism as to profit which translate itself into a wave of uncontrolled speculation in security result in the diversion of capital from business to the stock market and the inevitable crash the natural consequence have be a reduction in the consumption of luxury and semi necessity by those who have meet with loss and a number of person throw temporarily out of employment price of agricultural product deal in upon the great market have be affect in sympathy with the stock crash
 fortunately the federal reserve system have take measure to strengthen the position against the day when speculation would break which together with the strong position of the bank have carry the whole credit system through the crisis without impairment the capital which have be hitherto absorb in stock market loan for speculative purpose be now return to the normal channel of business there have be no inflation in the price of commodity there have be no undue accumulation of good and foreign trade have expand to a magnitude which exert a steadying influence upon activity in industry and employment
 the sudden threat of unemployment and especially the recollection of the economic consequence of previous crash under a much less secured financial system create unwarranted pessimism and fear it be recall that past storm of similar character have result in retrenchment of construction reduction of wage and lay off of worker the natural result be the tendency of business agency throughout the country to pause in their plan and proposal for continuation and extension of their business and this hesitation unchecked could in itself intensify into a depression with widespread unemployment and suffering
 i have therefore institute systematic voluntary measure of cooperation with the business institution and with state and municipal authority to make certain that fundamental business of the country shall continue as usual that wage and therefore consume power shall not be reduce and that a special effort shall be make to expand construction work in order to assist in equalize other deficit in employment due to the enlarged sense of cooperation and responsibility which have grow in the business world during the past few year the response have be remarkable and satisfactory we have canvass the federal government and institute measure of prudent expansion in such work that should be helpful and upon which the different department will make some early recommendation to congress
 i be convinced that through these measure we have reestablish confidence wage should remain stable a very large degree of industrial unemployment and suffering which would otherwise have occur have be prevent agricultural price have reflect the return confidence the measure take must be vigorously pursue until normal condition be restore
 agriculture
 the agricultural situation be improve the gross farm income as estimate by the department of agriculture for the crop season 1926 27 be $ 12,100,000,000 for 1927 28 it be $ 12,300,000,000 for 1928 29 it be $ 12,500,000,000 and estimate on the basis of price since the last harvest the value of the 1929 30 crop would be over $ 12,650,000,000 the slight decline in general commodity price during the past few year naturally assist the farmers&#39 buy power
 the number of farmer bankruptcy be very materially decrease below previous year the decline in land value now seem to be arrest and rate of movement from the farm to the city have be reduce not all section of agriculture of course have fare equally and some area have suffer from drought responsible farm leader have assure i that a large measure of confidence be return to agriculture and that a feeling of optimism pervade that industry
 the most extensive action for strengthen the agricultural industry ever take by any government be inaugurate through the farm marketing act of june 15 last under its provision the federal farm board have be establish comprise of man long and widely experience in agriculture and sponsor by the farm organization of the country during its short period of existence the board have take definite step toward a more efficient organization of agriculture toward the elimination of waste in marketing and toward the upbuilding of farmers&#39 marketing organization on sounder and more efficient line substantial headway have be make in the organization of four of the basic commodity grain cotton livestock and wool support by the board to cooperative marketing organization and other board activity undoubtedly have serve to steady the farmers&#39 market during the recent crisis and have operate also as a great stimulus to the cooperative organization of agriculture the problem of the industry be most complex and the need for sound organization be imperative yet the board be move rapidly along the line lay out for it in the act facilitate the creation by farmer of farmer own and farmer control organization and federate they into central institution with a view to increase the bargaining power of agriculture prevent and control surplus and mobilize the economic power of agriculture
 the tariff
 the special session of congress be call to expedite the fulfillment of party pledge of agricultural relief and the tariff the pledge of farm relief have be carry out at that time i state the principle upon which i believe action should be take in respect to the tariff
 an effective tariff upon agricultural product that will compensate the farmer&#39;s high cost and high standard of living have a dual purpose such a tariff not only protect the farmer in our domestic market but it also stimulate he to diversify his crop and to grow product that he could not otherwise produce and thus lessen his dependence upon export to foreign market the great expansion of production abroad under the condition i have mention render foreign competition in our export market increasingly serious it seem but natural therefore that the american farmer having be greatly handicap in his foreign market by such competition from the young expand country should ask that foreign access to our domestic market should be regulate by take into account the difference in our cost of production
 in consider the tariff for other industry than agriculture we find that there have be economic shift necessitate a readjustment of some of the tariff schedule seven year of experience under the tariff bill enact in 1922 have demonstrate the wisdom of congress in the enactment of that measure on the whole it have work well in the main our wage have be maintain at high level our export and import have steadily increase with some exception our manufacturing industry have be prosperous nevertheless economic change have take place during that time which have place certain domestic product at a disadvantage and new industry have come into being all of which create the necessity for some limited change in the schedule and in the administrative clause of the law as write in 1922
 it would seem to i that the test of necessity for revision be in the main whether there have be a substantial slackening of activity in an industry during the past few year and a consequent decrease of employment due to insurmountable competition in the product of that industry it be not as if we be set up a new basis of protective duty we do that seven year ago what we need to remedy now be whatever substantial loss of employment may have result from shift since that time
 in determine change in our tariff we must not fail to take into account the broad interest of the country as a whole and such interest include our trade relation with other country
 no condition have arise in my view to change these principle state at the opening of the special session i be firmly of the opinion that their application to the pende revision will give the country the kind of a tariff law it both need and want it would be most helpful if action should be take at an early moment more especially at a time when business and agriculture be both cooperate to minimize future uncertainty it be just that they should know what the rate be to be
 even a limited revision require the consideration and readjustment of many item the exhaustive inquiry and valuable debate from man representative of all part of the country which be need to determine the detailed rate must necessarily be accomplish in the congress however perfectly this rate structure may be frame at any give time the shifting of economic force which inevitably occur will render change in some item desirable between the necessarily long interval of congressional revision injustice be bind to develop such as be experience by the dairyman the flaxseed producer the glass industry and other under the 1922 rate for this reason i have be most anxious that the broad principle of the flexible tariff as provide in the exist law should be preserve and its delay in action avoid by more expeditious method of determine the cost of production at home and abroad with executive authority to promulgate such change upon recommendation of the tariff commission after exhaustive investigation change by the congress in the isolated item such as those to which i have refer would have be most unlikely both because of the concentration of opposition in the country who could see no advantage to their own industry or state and because of the difficulty of limit consideration by the congress to such isolated case
 there be no fundamental conflict between the interest of the farmer and the worker lower of the standard of living of either tend to destroy the other the prosperity of one rest upon the well being of the other nor be there any real conflict between the east and the west or the north and the south in the united states the complete interlocking of economic dependence the common strive for social and spiritual progress our common heritage as americans and the infinite web of national sentiment have create a solidarity in a great people unparalleled in all human history these invisible bond should not and can not be shatter by difference of opinion grow out of discussion of a tariff
 public buildings
 under the provision of various act of congress $ 300,000,000 have be authorize for public building and the land upon which to construct they be $ 75,000,000 for the district of columbia and $ 225,000,000 for the country at large exclude $ 25,000,000 which be for the acquisition of land in the so call triangle in this city this public building legislation provide for a five year program for the district of columbia and between an eight and nine year program for the country at large of this sum approximately $ 27,400,000 be expend up to june 30 last of which $ 11,400,000 have be expend in the district and $ 16,000,000 outside
 even this generous provision for both the district of columbia and the country be insufficient for most pressing governmental need expensive rent and inadequate facility be extravagance and not economy in the district even after the completion of these project we shall have fully 20,000 clerk house in rented and temporary war building which can last but a little long
 i therefore recommend that consideration should be give to the extension of authorization both for the country at large and for the district of columbia again distribute over a term of year a survey of the need in both category have be make by the secretary of the treasury and the postmaster general it would be helpful in the present economic situation if such step be take as would enable early construction work
 an expedition and enlargement of the program in the district would bring about direct economy in construction by enable the erection of building in regular sequence by maintain a stable labor force in the city contract can be make on more advantageous term
 the early completion of this program which be an acknowledge need would add dignity to the celebration in 1932 of the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of president washington
 in consideration of these project which contribute so much to dignify the national capital i should like to renew the suggestion that the fine arts commission should be require to pass upon private building which be propose for site face upon public building and park without such control much of the effort of the congress in beautification of the capital will be minimize
 the waterways and flood control
 the development of inland waterway have receive new impulse from the completion during this year of the canalization of the ohio to a uniform 9 foot depth the development of the other segment of the mississippi system should be expedite and with this in view i be recommend an increase in appropriation for river and harbor from $ 50,000,000 to $ 55,000,000 per annum which together with about $ 4,000,000 per annum release by completion of the ohio should make available after provide for other river and harbor work a sum of from $ 25,000,000 to $ 30,000,000 per annum for the mississippi system and thus bring it to early completion
 conflict of opinion which have arise over the propose floodway from the arkansas river to the gulf of mexico via the atchafalaya river have lead i to withhold construction upon this portion of the mississippi flood control plan until it could be again review by the engineer for any further recommendation to congress the other portion of the project be be vigorously prosecute and i have recommend an increase in appropriation for this from $ 30,000,000 of the present year to $ 35,000,000 during the next fiscal year
 expansion of our intracoastal waterway to effective barge depth be well warrant we be await the action of canada upon the st. lawrence waterway project
 highway
 there be over 3,000,000 mile of legally establish highway in the united states of which about 10 per cent be include in the state highway system the remainder be county and other local road about 626,000 mile have be improve with some type of surface comprise some 63 per cent of the state highway system and 16 per cent of the local road of the improved road about 102,000 mile be hard surfaced comprise about 22 per cent of the state highway system and about 8 per cent of the local road
 while proper planning should materially reduce the list mileage of public road particularly in the agricultural district and turn these road back to useful purpose it be evident that road construction must be a long continue program progress in improvement be about 50,000 mile of all type per annum of which some 12,000 mile be of the more durable type the total expenditure of federal state and local government last year for construction and maintenance assume the huge total of $ 1,660,000,000
 federal aid in the construction of the highway system in conjunction with the states have prove to be beneficial and stimulating we must ultimately give consideration to the increase of our contribution to these system particularly with a view to stimulate the improvement of farm to market road
 post office
 our post office deficit have now increase to over $ 80,000,000 a year of which perhaps $ 14,000,000 be due to loss on ocean mail and air mail contract the department be make an exhaustive study of the source of the deficit with view to later recommendation to congress in respect to it
 the post office quarter be provide in part by the federal construction in part by various form of rent and lease arrangement the practice have grow up in recent year of contract long term lease under which both rent and amortization principal cost of building be include i be advise that fully 40 per cent could be save from many such rent and lease agreement even after allow interest on the capital require at the normal government rate there be also many objectionable feature to some of these practice the provision of adequate quarter for the post office should be put on a sound basis
 a revision of air mail rate upon a more systematic and permanent footing be necessary the subject be under study and if legislation should prove necessary the subject will be present to the congress in the meantime i recommend that the congress should consider the desirability of authorize further expansion of the south american service
 commercial aviation
 during the past year progress in civil aeronautic have be remarkable this be to a considerable degree due to the wise assistance of the federal government through the establishment and maintenance of airway by the department of commerce and the mail contract from the post office department the government improve airway now exceed 25,000 mile more than 14,000 mile of which will be light and equip for night fly operation by the close of the current year airport construction through all the states be extremely active there be now 1,000 commercial and municipal airport in operation with an additional 1,200 propose for early development
 through this assistance the nation be build a sound aviation system operate by private enterprise over 6,400 plane be in commercial use and 9,400 pilot be license by the government our manufacturing capacity have rise to 7,500 plane per annum the aviation company have increase regular air transportation until it now total 90,000 mile per day one fourth of which be fly by night mail and express service now connect our principal city and extensive service for passenger transportation have be inaugurate and other of importance be imminent american air line now reach into canada and mexico to cuba porto rico central america and most of the important country of south america
 railway
 as a whole the railroad never be in such good physical and financial condition and the country have never be so well serve by they the great volume of freight traffic ever tender be be carry at a speed never before attain and with satisfaction to the shipper efficiency and new method have result in reduction in the cost of provide freight transportation and freight rate show a continuous descend line from the level enforce by the world war
 we have however not yet assure for the future that adequate system of transportation through consolidation which be the objective of the congress in the transportation act the chief purpose of consolidation be to secure well balance system with more uniform and satisfactory rate structure a more stable financial structure more equitable distribution of traffic great efficiency and single line instead of multiple line haul in this way the country will have the assurance of well service and ultimately at low and more even rate than would otherwise be attain legislation to simplify and expedite consolidation method and well to protect public interest should be enact
 consideration should also be give to relief of the member of the commission from the necessity of detailed attention to comparatively inconsequential matter which under the exist law must receive their direct and personal consideration it be in the public interest that the member of the commission should not be so press by minor matter that they have inadequate time for investigation and consideration of the large question commit to they for solution as to many of these minor matter the function of the commission might well be make revisory and the primary responsibility delegate to subordinate official after the practice long in vogue in the executive department
 merchant marine
 under the impulse of the merchant marine act of 1928 the transfer to private enterprise of the government own steamship line be go forward with increase success the shipping board now operate about 18 line which be less than half the number originally establish and the estimate of expenditure for the come fiscal year be base upon reduction in loss on government line by approximately one half construction loan have be make to the amount of approximately $ 75,000,000 out of the revolving fund authorize by congress and have furnish an additional aid to american shipping and far stimulate the building of vessel in american yard
 desirous of secure the full value to the nation of the great effort to develop our merchant marine by the merchant marine act soon after the inauguration of the present administration i appoint an interdepartmental committee consist of the secretary of commerce as chairman the secretary of the navy the postmaster general and the chairman of the shipping board to make a survey of the policy be pursue under the act of 1928 in respect of mail contract to inquire into its working and to advise the postmaster general in the administration of the act
 in particular it seem to i necessary to determine if the result of the contract already let would assure the purpose express in the act to far develop an american merchant marine to assure its permanence in the transportation of the foreign trade of the united states and for other purpose and to develop a coordinated policy by which these purpose may be translate into actuality
 in review of the mail contract already award it be find that they aggregate 25 separate award impose a governmental obligation of a little over $ 12,000,000 per annum provision have be impose in five of the contract for construction of new vessel with which to replace and expand service these requirement come to a total of 12 vessel in the 10 year period aggregate 122,000 ton some other condition in the contract have not work out satisfactorily
 that study have now be substantially complete and the committee have advise the desirability and the necessity of secure much large undertaking as to service and new construction in future contract the committee at this time be recommend the advertising of 14 additional route make substantial requirement for the construction of new vessel during the life of each contract recommend a total of 40 new vessel will be require under the contract propose about half of which will be require to be build during the next three year the capital cost of this new construction will be approximately $ 250,000,000 involve approximately 460,000 gross ton should bidder be find who will make these undertaking it will be necessary to recommend to congress an increase in the authorized expenditure by the post office of about $ 5,500,000 annually it will be most advantageous to grant such an authority
 a conflict as to the administration of the act have arise in the contention of person who have purchase shipping board vessel that they be entitle to mail contract irrespective of whether they be the low bidder the post office on the other hand be require by law to let contract in that manner it be urgent that congress should clarify this situation
 the banking system
 it be desirable that congress should consider the revision of some portion of the banking law
 the development of group and chain banking present many new problem the question naturally arise as to whether if allow to expand without restraint these method would dangerously concentrate control of credit and whether they would not in any event seriously threaten one of the fundamental of the american credit system which be that credit which be base upon banking deposit should be control by person within those area which furnish these deposit and thus be subject to the restraint of local interest and public opinion in those area to some degree however this movement of chain or group banking be a groping for strong support to the bank and a more secure basis for these institution
 the growth in size and stability of the metropolitan bank be in mark contrast to the trend in the country district with its many failure and the loss these failure have impose upon the agricultural community
 the relinquishment of charter of national bank in great commercial center in favor of state charter indicate that some condition surround the national bank which render they unable to compete with state bank and their withdrawal result in weaken our national banking system
 it have be propose that permission should be grant to national bank to engage in branch banking of a nature that would preserve within limited region the local responsibility and the control of such credit institution
 all these subject however require careful investigation and it might be find advantageous to create a joint commission embrace member of the congress and other appropriate federal official for subsequent report
 electrical power regulation
 the federal power commission be now comprise of three cabinet officer and the duty involve in the competent conduct of the grow responsibility of this commission far exceed the time and attention which these official can properly afford from other important duty i recommend that authority be give for the appointment of full time commissioner to replace they
 it be also desirable that the authority of the commission should be extend to certain phase of power regulation the nature of the electric utility industry be such that about 90 per cent of all power generation and distribution be intrastate in character and most of the states have develop their own regulatory system as to certificate of convenience rate and profit of such utility to encroach upon their authority and responsibility would be an encroachment upon the right of the states there be case however of interstate character beyond the jurisdiction of the states to meet these case it would be most desirable if a method could be work out by which initial action may be take between the commission of the states whose joint action should be make effective by the federal power commission with a reserve to act on its own motion in case of disagreement or nonaction by the states
 the radio commission
 i recommend the reorganization of the radio commission into a permanent body from its present temporary status the requirement of the present law that the commissioner shall be appoint from specified zone should be abolish and a general provision make for their equitable selection from different part of the country despite the effort of the commissioner the present method develop a public insistence that the commissioner be specially charge with supervision of radio affair in the zone from which each be appoint as a result there be danger that the system will degenerate from a national system into five regional agency with varying practice vary policy competitive tendency and consequent failure to attain its utmost capacity for service to the people as a whole
 muscle shoal
 it be most desirable that this question should be dispose of under present condition the income from these plant be less than could otherwise be secure for its use and more especially the public be not secure the full benefit which could be obtain from they
 it be my belief that such part of these plant as would be useful and the revenue from the remainder should be dedicate for all time to the farmer of the united states for investigation and experimentation on a commercial scale in agricultural chemistry by such mean advance discovery of science can be systematically apply to agricultural need and development of the chemical industry of the tennessee valley can be assure
 i do not favor the operation by the government of either power or manufacturing business except as an unavoidable by product of some other major public purpose
 any form of settlement of this question will imply enter upon a contract or contract for the lease of the plant either as a whole or in part and the reservation of facility product or income for agricultural purpose the extremely technical and involved nature of such contract deal with chemical and electrical enterprise add to the unusual difficulty surround these special plant and the rapid commercial change now in progress in power and synthetic nitrogen manufacture lead i to suggest that congress create a special commission not to investigate and report as in the past but with authority to negotiate and complete some sort of contract or contract on behalf of the government subject of course to such general requirement as congress may stipulate
 boulder dam
 the secretary of the interior be make satisfactory progress in negotiation of the very complex contract require for the sale of the power to be generate at this project these contract must assure the return of all government outlay upon the project i recommend that the necessary fund be appropriate for the initiation of this work as soon as the contract be in the hand of congress
 conservation
 conservation of national resource be a fix policy of the government three important question bear upon conservation of the public land have become urgent
 conservation of our oil and gas resource against future need be a national necessity the working of the oil permit system in development of oil and gas resource on the public domain have be subject to great abuse i consider it necessary to suspend the issuance of such permit and to direct the review of all outstanding permit as to compliance of the holder with the law the purpose be not only to end such abuse but to place the government in position to review the entire subject
 we be also confront with a major problem in conservation due to the overgrazing on public land the effect of overgrazing which have now become general be not only to destroy the range but by impair the ground coverage seriously to menace the water supply in many part of the west through quick run off spring flood and autumn drought
 we have a third problem of major dimension in the reconsideration of our reclamation policy the inclusion of most of the available land of the public domain in exist or plan reclamation project largely complete the original purpose of the reclamation service there still remain the necessity for extensive storage of water in the arid states which render it desirable that we should give a wide vision and purpose to this service
 to provide for careful consideration of these question and also of well division of responsibility in they as between the state and federal governments include the possible transfer to the states for school purpose of the land unreserve for forest park power mineral etc i have appoint a commission on conservation of the public domain with a membership represent the major public land states and at the same time the public at large i recommend that congress should authorize a moderate sum to defray their expense
 social service
 the federal government provide for an extensive and valuable program of constructive social service in education home building protection to woman and child employment public health recreation and many other direction
 in a broad sense federal activity in these direction have be confine to research and dissemination of information and experience and at most to temporary subsidy to the states in order to secure uniform advancement in practice and method any other attitude by the federal government will undermine one of the most precious possession of the american people that be local and individual responsibility we should adhere to this policy
 federal official can however make a further and most important contribution by leadership in stimulation of the community and voluntary agency and by extend federal assistance in organization of these force and bring about cooperation among they
 as an instance of this character i have recently in cooperation with the secretaries of interior and labor lay the foundation of an exhaustive inquiry into the fact precedent to a nation wide white house conference on child health and protection this cooperative movement among interested agency will impose no expense upon the government similar nation wide conference will be call in connection with well housing and recreation at a later date
 in view of the considerable difference of opinion as to the policy which should be pursue by the federal government with respect to education i have appoint a committee representative of the important educational association and other to investigate and present recommendation in cooperation with the secretary of the interior i have also appoint a voluntary committee of distinguished membership to assist in a nation wide movement for abolition of illiteracy
 i have recommend additional appropriation for the federal employment service in order that it may more fully cover its cooperative work with state and local service i have also recommend additional appropriation for the women&#39;s and children&#39;s bureaus for much need research as to fact which i feel will prove most helpful
 public health
 the advance in scientific discovery as to disease and health impose new consideration upon we the nation as a whole be vitally interested in the health of all the people in protection from spread of contagious disease in the relation of physical and mental disability to criminality and in the economic and moral advancement which be fundamentally associate with sound body and mind the organization of preventive measure and health education in its personal application be the province of public health service such organization should be as universal as public education its support be a proper burden upon the taxpayer it can not be organize with success either in its sanitary or educational phase except under public authority it should be base upon local and state responsibility but i consider that the federal government have an obligation of contribution to the establishment of such agency
 in the practical working out of organization exhaustive experiment and trial have demonstrate that the base should be competent organization of the municipality county or other local unit most of our municipality and some 400 rural county out of 3,000 now have some such unit organization where highly develop a health unit comprise at least a physician sanitary engineer and community nurse with the addition in some case of another nurse devote to the problem of maternity and child such organization give at once a fundamental control of preventive measure and assist in community instruction the federal government through its interest in control of contagion act through the united states public health service and the state agency have in the past and should in the future concern itself with this development particularly in the many rural section which be unfortunately far behind in progress some part of the fund contribute under the sheppard towner act through the children&#39;s bureau of the department of labor have also find their way into these channel
 i recommend to the congress that the purpose of the sheppard towner act should be continue through the children&#39;s bureau for a limited period of year and that the congress should consider the desirability of confine the use of federal fund by the states to the building up of such county or other local unit and that such outlay should be positively coordinate with the fund expend through the united states public health service direct to other phase of the same county or other local unit organization all fund appropriate should of course be apply through the states so that the public health program of the county or local unit will be efficiently coordinate with that of the whole state
 federal prisons
 closely related to crime condition be the administration of the federal prison system our federal penal institution be overcrowded and this condition be daily become bad the parole and probation system be inadequate these condition make it impossible to perform the work of personal reconstruction of prisoner so as to prepare they for return to the duty of citizenship in order to relieve the press evil i have direct the temporary transfer of the army disciplinary barracks at leavenworth to the department of justice for use as a federal prison not only be this temporary but it be inadequate for present need
 we need some new federal prison and a reorganization of our probation and parole system and there should be establish in the department of justice a bureau of prisons with a sufficient force to deal adequately with the grow activity of our prison institution authorization for the improvement should be give speedily with initial appropriation to allow the construction of the new institution to be undertake at once
 immigration
 restriction of immigration have from every aspect prove a sound national policy our press problem be to formulate a method by which the limited number of immigrant whom we do welcome shall be adapt to our national setting and our national need
 i have be oppose to the basis of the quota now in force and i have hope that we could find some practical method to secure what i believe should be our real national objective that is fitness of the immigrant as to physique character training and our need of service perhaps some system of priority within the quota could produce these result and at the same time enable some hardship in the present system to be clear up i recommend that the congress should give the subject further study in which the executive department will gladly cooperate with the hope of discover such method as will more fully secure our national necessity
 veteran
 it have be the policy of our government almost from its inception to make provision for the man who have be disable in defense of our country this policy should be maintain originally it take the form of land grant and pension this system continue until our entry into the world war the congress at that time inaugurate a new plan of compensation rehabilitation hospitalization medical care and treatment and insurance whereby benefit be award to those veteran and their immediate dependent whose disability be attributable to their war service the basic principle in this legislation be sound
 in a desire to eliminate all possibility of injustice due to difficulty in establish service connection of disability these principle have be to some degree extend veteran whose disease or injury have become apparent within a brief period after the war be now receive compensation insurance benefit have be liberalize emergency officer be now receive additional benefit the door of the government&#39; hospital have be open to all veteran even though their disease or injury be not the result of their war service in addition adjust service certificate have be issue to 3,433,300 veteran this in itself will mean an expenditure of nearly $ 3,500,000,000 before 1945 in addition to the $ 600,000,000 which we be now appropriate annually for our veterans&#39 relief
 the administration of all law concern the veteran and their dependent have be upon the basis of deal generously humanely and justly while some inequality have arise substantial and adequate care have be give and justice administer further improvement in administration may require some amendment from time to time to the law but care should be take to see that such change conform to the basic principle of the legislation
 i be convinced that we will gain in efficiency economy and more uniform administration and well definition of national policy if the pension bureau the national home for volunteer soldiers and the veterans&#39 bureau be bring together under a single agency the total appropriation to these agency now exceed $ 800,000,000 per annum
 civil service
 approximately four fifth of all the employee in the executive civil service now occupy position subject to competitive examination under the civil service law
 there be however still command opportunity for extend the system these opportunity lie within the province of congress and not the president i recommend that a further step be take by authorization that appointment of third class postmaster be make under the civil service law
 departmental reorganization
 this subject have be under consideration for over 20 year it be promise by both political party in the recent campaign it have be repeatedly examine by committee and commission congressional executive and voluntary the conclusion of these investigation have be unanimous that reorganization be a necessity of sound administration of economy of more effective governmental policy and of relief to the citizen from unnecessary harassment in his relation with a multitude of scatter governmental agency but the presentation of any specific plan at once enliven opposition from every official whose authority may be curtail or who fear his position be imperil by such a result of bureaus and department which wish to maintain their authority and activity of citizen and their organization who be selfishly interested or who be inspire by fear that their favorite bureau may in a new setting be less subject to their influence or more subject to some other influence
 it seem to i that the essential principle of reorganization be two in number first all administrative activity of the same major purpose should be place in group under single headed responsibility second all executive and administrative function should be separate from board and commission and place under individual responsibility while quasi legislative and quasi judicial and broadly advisory function should be remove from individual authority and assign to board and commission indeed these be the fundamental principle upon which our government be found and they be the principle which have be adhere to in the whole development of our business structure and they be the distillation of the common sense of generation
 for instance the conservation of national resource be spread among eight agency in five department they suffer from conflict and overlap there be no proper development and adherence to broad national policy and no central point where the searchlight of public opinion may concentrate itself these function should be group under the direction of some such official as an assistant secretary of conservation the particular department or cabinet officer under which such a group should be place be of secondary importance to the need of concentration the same may be say of educational service of merchant marine aid of public work of public health of veterans&#39 service and many other the component part of which be widely scatter in the various department and independent agency it be desirable that we first have experience with these different group in action before we create new department these may be necessary later on
 with this background of all previous experience i can see no hope for the development of a sound reorganization of the government unless congress be willing to delegate its authority over the problem subject to define principle to the executive who should act upon approval of a joint committee of congress or with the reservation of power of revision by congress within some limited period adequate for its consideration
 prohibition
 the first duty of the president under his oath of office be to secure the enforcement of the law the enforcement of the law enact to give effect to the eighteenth amendment be far from satisfactory and this be in part due to the inadequate organization of the administrative agency of the federal government with the hope of expedite such reorganization i request on june 6 last that congress should appoint a joint committee to collaborate with executive agency in preparation of legislation it would be helpful if it could be so appoint the subject have be earnestly consider by the law enforcement commission and the administrative official of the government our joint conclusion be that certain step should be take at once first there should be an immediate concentration of responsibility and strengthening of enforcement agency of the federal government by transfer to the department of justice of the federal function of detection and to a considerable degree of prosecution which be now lodge in the prohibition bureau in the treasury and at the same time the control of the distribution of industrial alcohol and legalized beverage should remain in the treasury second provision should be make for relief of congestion in the federal court by modify and simplify the procedure for deal with the large volume of petty prosecution under various federal act third there should be a codification of the law relate to prohibition to avoid the necessity which now exist of resort to more than 25 statute enact at various time over 40 year technical defect in these statute that have be disclose should be cure i would add to these recommendation the desirability of reorganize the various service engage in the prevention of smuggle into one border patrol under the coast guard further recommendation upon the subject as a whole will be develop after further examination by the law enforcement commission but it be not to be expect that any criminal law will ever be fully enforce so long as criminal exist
 the district of columbia should be the model of city law enforcement in the nation while condition here be much well than in many other city they be far from perfect and this be due in part to the congestion of criminal case in the supreme court of the district result in long delay furthermore there be need for legislation in the district supplement the national prohibition act more sharply define and enlarge the duty and power of the district commissioners and the police of the district and open the way for well cooperation in the enforcement of prohibition between the district official and the prohibition officer of the federal government it be urgent that these condition be remedie
 law enforcement and observance
 no one will look with satisfaction upon the volume of crime of all kind and the growth of organize crime in our country we have press need so to organize our system of administer criminal justice as to establish full vigor and effectiveness we need to reestablish faith that the high interest of our country be serve by insistence upon the swift and even handed administration of justice to all offender whether they be rich or poor that we shall effect improvement be vital to the preservation of our institution it be the most serious issue before our people
 under the authority of congress i have appoint a national commission on law observance and enforcement for an exhaustive study of the entire problem of the enforcement of our law and the improvement of our judicial system include the special problem and abuse grow out of the prohibition law the commission have be invite to make the wide inquiry into the shortcoming of the administration of justice and into the cause and remedy for they it have organize its work under subcommittee deal with the many contributory cause of our situation and have enlist the aid of investigator in field require special consideration i be confident that as a result of its study now be carry forward it will make a notable contribution to the solution of our press problem
 pende further legislation the department of justice have be strive to weed out inefficiency wherever it exist to stimulate activity on the part of its prosecute officer and to use increase care in examine into the qualification of those appoint to serve as prosecutor the department be seek systematically to strengthen the law enforcement agency week by week and month by month not by dramatic display but by steady pressure by removal of negligent official and by encouragement and assistance to the vigilant during the course of these effort it have be reveal that in some district cause contribute to the congestion of criminal docket and to delay and inefficiency in prosecution have be lack of sufficient force in the office of united states attorney clerk of court and marshal these condition tend to clog the machinery of justice the last conference of senior circuit judge have take note of they and indorse the department&#39;s proposal for improvement increase in appropriation be necessary and will be ask for in order to reenforce these office
 the orderly administration of the law involve more than the mere machinery of law enforcement the efficient use of that machinery and a spirit in our people in support of law be alike essential we have need for improvement in both however much we may perfect the mechanism still if the citizen who be himself dependent upon some law for the protection of all that he have and all that he hold dear shall insist on select the particular law which he will obey he undermine his own safety and that of his country his attitude may obscure but it can not conceal the ugly truth that the lawbreaker whoever he may be be the enemy of society we can no long glos over the unpleasant reality which should be make vital in the consciousness of every citizen that he who condone or traffic with crime who be indifferent to it and to the punishment of the criminal or to the lax performance of official duty be himself the most effective agency for the breakdown of society
 law can not rise above its source in good citizenship in what right minded man most earnestly believe and desire if the law be uphold only by government official then all law be at an end our law be make by the people themselves theirs be the right to work for their repeal but until repeal it be an equal duty to observe they and demand their enforcement
 i have be gratify at the awakening sense of this responsibility in our citizen during the past few month and gratify that many instance have occur which refute the cynicism which have assert that our system could not convict those who have defy the law and possess the mean to resist its execution these thing reveal a moral awakening both in the people and in official which lie at the very foundation of the rule of law
 conclusion
 the test of the rightfulness of our decision must be whether we have sustain and advance the ideal of the american people self government in its foundation of local government justice whether to the individual or to the group order liberty freedom from domination open opportunity and equality of opportunity the initiative and individuality of our people prosperity and the lessening of poverty freedom of public opinion education advancement of knowledge the growth of religious spirit the tolerance of all faith the foundation of the home and the advancement of peace


 the departments of commerce and labor be engage in the usual monthly survey of business and unemployment and especially of the result obtain from the measure which have be in progress since the last of november to reduce unemployment and the hardship follow the dislocation from the stock exchange crash the survey be not as yet complete there be however certain conclusion that be evident
 1 unemployment amounting to distress be in the main concentrated in 12 state the authority in the remain 36 states indicate only normal seasonal unemployment or that the minor abnormal unemployment be be rapidly absorb
 2 the low point of business and employment be the latter part of december and early january since that time employment have be slowly increase and the situation be much well today than at that time
 3 nationwide response to the request for increase construction and improvement work by public authority railroad utility and industry be have a most material effect construction contract in these category in january and february be from 40 percent to 45 percent high than ever know in those month the total construction work for 1930 seem assure to be large than even 1929
 4 the undertaking to maintain wage have be hold
 5 the amount of unemployment be in proportion to the number of worker considerably less than one half probably only one third of that which result from the crash of 1907 08 and 1920 22 at this period of the situation
 6 measure take to ameliorate interest rate have result in continuous decrease since december and money be available at low rate for business and commercial purpose one result be an increase volume of bond issue have be place for public improvement available money for mortgage purpose of home building and agriculture have lag behind other form of credit but a decrease in demand of policyholder for loan on the insurance company and the action recently take by the federal reserve system should result in increase supply of credit especially for residential building which in turn have lag behind other construction
 7 all the evidence indicate that the bad effect of the crash upon employment will have be pass during the next 60 day with the amelioration of seasonal unemployment the gain strength of other force and the continued cooperation of the many agency actively cooperate with the government to restore business and to relieve distress

in my message of june 6th and december 3rd 1929 i place before congress the urgency of certain improvement necessary to effective criminal law enforcement substantial progress have be make upon some of the measure propose yet we be near the end of the present session and i can not too strongly urge the necessity of action upon all these recommendation before adjournment the most important recommendation make by i be five in number
 1 there should be a transfer of the function of detection and prosecution of prohibition case from the treasury department to the department of justice and thus an ending of divide responsibility and effort an act provide for this transfer be pass by the house of representatives and have now be report to the senate by its judiciary committee
 2 there must be relief afford from congestion in the court while this congestion be evidence by the docket in many court its full implication be not show by they the so call bargain days when light fine be impose as the result of plea of guilty clear the docket but the result distinctly undermine respect for law no conclusion appear to have be reach as to the method of accomplish this either by the judiciary committee of the senate or by the judiciary committee of the house of representatives
 3 there must be extension of federal prison with more adequate parole system and other modern treatment of prisoner we have already 11,985 prisoner in federal establishment build for 6,946 the number of federal prisoner in federal and state institution increase 6,277 in the nine month from june 30 1929 to april 1 1930 the attorney general have state that we can not hope to enforce the law unless we can have some point of reception for convict person the overcrowding of the prison themselves be inhumane and accentuate criminal tendency bill provide for this relief be pass by the house and be now i understand in course of be report to the senate by the judiciary committee
 4 we be in need of vigorous reorganization of the border patrol in order to consolidate various agency so as effectually to prevent illegal entry of both alien and good proposal to bring about such reorganization be before the committees of congress
 5 the district of columbia be without an adequate prohibition enforcement law a bill for that purpose have be introduce and hearing have be hold before the senate district committee it should contain the safeguard recommend by the attorney general
 we have within the limit of exist legislation improve the personnel and greatly increase the efficiency of the exist federal machinery in criminal law enforcement during the past year the above reform be necessary however if i be to perform the high duty which fail upon the executive of enforcement of the federal law
 while a considerable part of this condition arise from the law relate to intoxicate liquor yet the law relate to narcotic automobile theft etc which have be enact by the congress during recent year also contribute to create the present condition this be well indicate by the fact that less than one third of federal prisoner be due to prohibition
 our obedience to law our law enforcement and judicial organization our judicial procedure our care and method of handle prisoner in relation to not only federal government but also to the state and municipal government be far from the standard that must be secure these proposal while they do not comprehend the whole which remain to be do in the nation be a step toward lift the federal standard which must have a general beneficial influence

i shall approve the tariff bill this legislation have now be under almost continuous consideration by congress for nearly 15 month it be undertake as the result of pledge give by the republican party at kansas city its declaration embrace these obligation
 the republican party believe that the home market build up under the protective policy belong to the american farmer and it pledge its support of legislation which will give this market to he to the full extent of his ability to supply it
 there be certain industry which can not now successfully compete with foreign producer because of low foreign wage and a low cost of live abroad and we pledge the next republican congress to an examination and where necessary a revision of these schedule to the end that the american labor in these industry may again command the home market may maintain its standard of living and may count upon steady employment in its accustomed field
 platform promise must not be empty gesture in my message of april 16 1929 to the special session of the congress i accordingly recommend an increase in agricultural protection a limited revision of other schedule to take care of the economic change necessitating increase or decrease since the enactment of the 1922 law and i far recommend a reorganization both of the tariff commission and of the method of execute the flexible provision
 a statistical estimate of the bill by the tariff commission show that the average duty collect under the 1922 law be about 13.8 percent of the value of all import both free and dutiable while if the new law have be apply it would have increase this percentage to about 16.0 percent
 this compare with the average level of the tariff under
 the mckinley law of 23.0
 the wilson law of 20.9
 the dingley law of 25.8
 the payne aldrich law of 19.3
 the fordney mccumber law of 13.83
 under the underwood law of 1913 the amount be disturb by war condition vary 6 percent to 14.8 percent
 the proportion of import which will be free of duty under the new law be estimate at from 61 to 63 percent this compare with average under
 the mckinley law of 52.4
 the wilson law of 49.4
 the dingley law of 45.2
 the payne aldrich law of 52.5
 the fordney mccumber law of 63.8
 under the underwood law of 1913 disturb condition vary the free list from 60 percent to 73 percent average 66.3 percent
 the increase in tariff be largely direct to the interest of the farmer of the increase it be state by the tariff commission that 93.73 percent be upon product of agricultural origin measure in value as distinguish from 6.25 percent upon commodity of strictly nonagricultural origin the average rate upon agricultural raw material show an increase from 38.10 percent to 48.92 percent in contrast to dutiable article of strictly other than agricultural origin which show an average increase of from 31.02 percent to 34.31 percent compensatory duty have necessarily be give on product manufacture from agricultural raw material and protective rate add to these in some instance
 the extent of rate revision as indicate by the tariff commission be that in value of the total import the duty upon approximately 22.5 percent have be increase and 77.5 percent be untouched or decrease by number of the dutiable item mention in the bill out of the total of about 3,300 there be about 890 increase 235 decrease and 2,170 untouched the number of item increase be therefore 27 percent of all dutiable item and compare with 83 percent of the number of item which be increase in the 1922 revision
 this tariff law be like all other tariff legislation whether frame primarily .upon a protective or a revenue basis it contain many compromise between sectional interest and between different industry no tariff bill have ever be enact or ever will be enact under the present system that will be perfect a large portion of the item be always adjust with good judgment but it be bind to contain some inequality and inequitable compromise there be item upon which duty will prove too high and other upon which duty will prove to be too low
 certainly no president with his other duty can pretend to make that exhaustive determination of the complex fact which surround each of those 3,300 item and which have require the attention of hundred of man in congress for nearly a year and a third that responsibility must rest upon the congress in a legislative rate revision
 on the administrative side i have insist however that there should be create a new basis for the flexible tariff and it have be incorporate in this law thereby the mean be establish for objective and judicial review of these rate upon principle lay down by the congress free from pressure inherent in legislative action thus the outstanding step of this tariff legislation have be the reorganization of the largely inoperative flexible provision of 1922 into a form which should render it possible to secure prompt and scientific adjustment of serious inequity and inequality which may prove to have be incorporate in the bill
 this new provision have even a large importance if a perfect tariff bill be enact today the increase rapidity of economic change and the constant shifting of our relation to industry abroad will create a continuous stream of item which would work hardship upon some segment of the american people except for the provision of this relief without a workable flexible provision we would require even more frequent congressional tariff revision than during the past with it the country should be free from further general revision for many year to come congressional revision be not only disturbing to business but with all their necessary collateral surrounding in lobby log rolling and the activity of group interest be disturbing to public confidence
 under the old flexible provision the task of adjustment be impose directly upon the president and the limitation in the law which circumscribe it be such that action be long delay and it be largely inoperative although important benefit be bring to the dairying flax glass and other industry through it
 the new flexible provision establish the responsibility for revision upon a reorganize tariff commission compose of member equal of both party as a definite rate make body act through semi judicial method of open hearing and investigation by which item can be take up one by one upon direction or upon application of aggrieved party recommendation be to be make to the president he be give authority to promulgate or veto the conclusion of the commission such revision can be accomplish without disturbance to business as they concern but one item at a time and the principle lay down assure a protective basis
 the principle of a protective tariff for the benefit of labor industry and the farmer be establish in the bill by the requirement that the commission shall adjust the rate so as to cover the difference in cost of production at home and abroad and it be authorize to increase or decrease the duty by 50 percent to effect this end the mean and method of ascertain such difference by the commission be provide in such fashion as should expedite prompt and effective action if grievance develop
 when the flexible principle be first write into law in 1922 by tradition and force of habit the old conception of legislative revision be so firmly fix that the innovation be bind to be use with caution and in a restricted field even have it not be largely inoperative for other reason now however and particularly after the record of the last 15 month there be a grow and widespread realization that in this highly complicated and intricately organize and rapidly shift modern economic world the time have come when a more scientific and businesslike method of tariff revision must be devise toward this the new flexible provision take a long step
 these provision meet the repeat demand of statesman and industrial and agricultural leader over the past 25 year it comply in full degree with the proposal make 20 year ago by president roosevelt it now cover proposal which i urge in 1922
 if however by any chance the flexible provision now make should prove insufficient for effective action i shall ask for further authority for the commission for i believe that public opinion will give wholehearte support to the carrying out of such a program on a generous scale to the end that we may develop a protective system free from the vice which have characterize every tariff revision in the past
 the complaint from some foreign country that these duty have be place unduly high can be remedie if justify by proper application to the tariff commission
 it be urgent that the uncertainty in the business world which have be add to by the long extend debate of the measure should be end they can be end only by completion of this bill meritorious demand for further protection to agriculture and labor which have develop since the tariff of 1922 would not end if this bill fail of enactment agitation for legislative tariff revision would necessarily continue before the country nothing would contribute to retard business recovery more than this continue agitation
 as i have say i do not assume the rate structure in this or any other tariff bill be perfect but i be convinced that the disposal of the whole question be urgent i believe that the flexible provision can within reasonable time remedy inequality that this provision be a progressive advance and give great hope of take the tariff away from politic lobbying and log roll that the bill give protection to agriculture for the market of its product and to several industry in need of such protection for the wage of their labor that with return normal condition our foreign trade will continue to expand

to the senate
 in request the senate to convene in session for the special purpose of deal with the treaty for the limitation and reduction of naval armament sign at london april 22 1930 it be desirable that i should present my view upon it this be especially necessary because of misinformation and misrepresentation which have be widespread by those who in reality be oppose to all limitation and reduction in naval arm we must naturally expect opposition from those group who believe in unrestricted military strength as an objective of the american nation indeed we find the same type of mind in great britain and japan in parallel opposition to this treaty nevertheless i be convinced that the overwhelming majority of the american people be oppose to the conception of these group our people believe that military strength should be hold in conformity with the sole purpose of national defense they earnestly desire real progress in limitation and reduction of naval arm of the world and their aspiration be for abolition of competition in the building of arm as a step toward world peace such a result can be obtain in no other way than by international agreement
 the present treaty be one which hold these safeguard and advance these ideal its ratification be in the interest of the united states it be fair to the other participate nation it promote the cause of good relation
 the only alternative to this treaty be the competitive building of navy with all its flow of suspicion hate ill will and ultimate disaster history support those who hold to agreement as the path to peace every naval limitation treaty with which we be familiar from the rush bagot agreement of 1817 limit vessel of war on the great lakes to the washington arm treaty of 1921 have result in a marked growth of good will and confidence between the nation which be party to it
 it be folly to think that because we be the rich nation in the world we can out build all other country other nation will make any sacrifice to maintain their instrument of defense against we and we shall eventually reap in their hostility and ill will the full measure of the additional burden which we may thus impose upon they the very entry of the united states into such course as this would invite the consolidation of the rest of the world against we and bring our peace and independence into jeopardy we have only to look at the state of europe in 1914 to find ample evidence of the futility and danger of competition in arm
 it will be remember that in response to recommendation from the senate a conference between the united states great britain and japan for limitation of those category of naval arm not cover by the washington treaty of 1921 be hold at geneva in 1927 that conference fail because the united states could not agree to the large size of fleet demand by other government the standard set up at that time would have require an ultimate fleet of about 1,400,000 ton for the united states as against this the total united states fleet set out under this treaty will be about 1,123,000 ton
 defense be the primary function of government and therefore our first concern in examination of any act of this character be the test of its adequacy in defense no critic have yet assert that with the navy provide in this agreement together with our army our aerial defense and our national resource we can not defend ourselves and certainly we want no military establishment for the purpose of domination of other nation our naval defense position under this treaty be the more clear if we examine our present naval strength in comparison to the present strength of the other nation and then examine the improvement in this proportion which will result from this treaty this improvement arise from the anticipation of parity in battleship to be reach 10 year hence under the washington arm treaty and the fact that other nation have be build in the class of ship not limit by that treaty while we until lately lag behind
 on the 1st of january last the total naval tonnage disregard paper fleet and take only those ship actually build and building be for the united states 1,180,000 ton for the british empire 1,332,000 ton for japan 768,000 ton that be if the united states navy be take as 100 then the british navy equal 113 and the japanese navy 65 under this treaty the united states will have 1,123,000 ton great britain 1,151,000 ton and japan 714,000 ton or a ratio of 100 for the united states to 102.4 for great britain and 63.6 for japan the slightly large tonnage ratio mention for great britain be due to the fact that her cruiser fleet will be constitute more largely of small vessel weak in gun power but the united states have the option to duplicate the exact tonnage and gun caliber of the british cruiser fleet if we desire to exercise it
 the relative improvement in the position of the united states under this treaty be even well than this statement would indicate in the more important category battleship aircraft carrier 8 inch and 6 inch cruiser that is omit the secondary arm of destroyer and submarine the fleet build and actually build on january 1 of this year be 809,000 ton in the united states 1,088,000 ton in great britain and 568,000 ton in japan or upon the basis of 100 for the united states it be 134 for great britain and 70 for japan under this treaty the united states will on january 1 1937 possess complete 911,000 ton of these major unit great britain 948,000 ton and japan 556,000 ton in addition the united states will have one 10,000 ton 8 inch cruiser two third complete this will give a ratio in these category of 100 for the united states to 102.9 for great britain and 60.5 for japan the reason for the excess british tonnage be again as mention above in other word the united states in these category increase by 102,000 ton great britain decrease by 140,000 ton and japan decrease by 12,000 ton these readjustment of unit be to take place during the next six year the treaty then come to an end except for such arrangement as may be make then for its continuance
 the major discussion have be direct almost wholly to the fact that the united states be to have 18 cruiser arm with 8 inch gun with an aggregate tonnage of 180,000 ton as against great britain&#39;s 15 such ship with a tonnage of 146,800 ton and japan&#39;s 12 such ship of a tonnage of 108,400 ton the united states supplement this tonnage with cruiser arm with 6 inch gun up to a total of 323,500 ton great britain up to 339,000 ton and japan to 208,800 ton the large gross tonnage to great britain as state be compensation for the large gun caliber of the american cruiser fleet but as say the united states have the option to duplicate the british fleet if it so desire
 criticism of this arrangement arise from the fact that the general board of the united states navy recommend that to reach parity with great britain the united states should have three more of the 10,000 ton cruiser 21 instead of 18 with 8 inch gun and a total of 315,000 ton or 8,000 ton less total cruiser tonnage than this treaty provide thus this treaty provide that instead of this 30,000 ton more of 8 inch ship recommend by the general board we will have 38,000 ton of ship arm with 6 inch gun there be no limitation upon the size of cruiser up to 10,000 ton therefore criticism revolve around less than 3 per cent of our whole fleet and even within this 3 per cent come the less question of whether 30,000 ton of ship arm with 8 inch gun be well than 38,000 ton arm with 6 inch gun the opinion of our high naval authority be divide on the relative merit of these alternative many earnestly believe that the large tonnage of 6 inch ship be more advantageous and other vice versa however those who seek to make this the outstanding feature of criticism fail to mention that under the london treaty the obligation of the washington arm treaty of 1921 be so altered that great britain scrap 133,900 ton of battleship arm with 13&#1029;-inch gun the united states scrap 70,000 ton of battleship arm with 12 inch gun and japan scrap 26,300 ton these arrangement be make not only for reduction of arm but to anticipate the ultimate parity between the united states and great britain in battleship which would not otherwise be realize for several year
 there be in this provision a relative gain in proportion compare with the british fleet of 63,900 ton of battleship with 13 1/2 inch gun this be of vastly more importance than the dispute as to the relative combatant strength of 38,000 ton of 6 inch cruiser against 30,000 ton of 8 inch cruiser indeed it would seem that such criticism must be base upon an undisclosed desire to break down all limitation of arm
 to those who seek earnestly and properly for reduction in warship i would point out that as compare with january 1 of this year the total aggregate navy of the three power under this treaty will have be reduce by nearly 300,000 ton have a settlement be make at geneva in 1927 upon the only proposal possible at that time the fleet of the three power would have be approximately 680,000 ton great than under the treaty now in consideration
 the economic burden and the diversion of taxis from welfare purpose which would be impose upon ourselves and other nation by failure of this treaty be worth consideration under its provision the replacement of battleship require under the washington arm treaty of 1921 be postpone for six year the cost of replace and maintain the three scrap battleship be save likewise we make economy in construction and operation by the reduction in our submarine and destroyer fleet to 52,700 and 150,000 ton respectively what the possible saving over an otherwise inevitable era of competitive building would be no one can estimate
 if we assume that our present naval program except for this treaty be to complete the ship authorize by congress and those authorized and necessary to be replace under the washington arm treaty and to maintain a destroyer fleet of about 225,000 ton and a submarine fleet of 90,000 ton such a fleet will not reach parity with great britain yet would cost in construction over $ 500,000,000 more during the next six year than the fleet provide under this treaty but in addition to this as state there be a very large saving by this treaty in annual operation of the fleet over what would be the case if we even build no more than the present program
 the more selfish minded will give little credence to the argument that saving by other party to the agreement in the limitation of naval construction be of interest to the american people yet the fundamental economic fact be that if the resource of these other nation be free for devotion to the welfare of their people and to pacific purpose of reproductive commerce they will result in blessing to the world include ourselves if we be to accept the geneva conference base as the end of naval strength under competitive building for the three government the saving in construction and operation by the treaty be literally billion of dollar
 the question before we now be not whether we shall have a treaty with either three more 8 inch cruiser or four less 6 inch cruiser or whether we shall have a large reduction in tonnage it be whether we shall have this treaty or no treaty it be a question as to whether we shall move strongly toward limitation and reduction in naval arm or whether we shall have no limitation or reduction and shall enter upon a disastrous period of competitive armament
 this treaty do mark an important step in disarmament and in world peace it be important for many reason that it should be deal with at once the subject have be under discussion since the geneva conference three year ago the line of this treaty have be know and under discussion since last summer the actual document have be before the american people and before the senate for nearly three month it have be favorably report by the senate foreign relations committee every solitary fact which affect judgment upon the treaty be know and the document itself comprise the sole obligation of the united states if we fail now the world will be again plunge backward from its progress toward peace

member of the american bankers association and guest
 i be glad to meet with this assembly of representative banker from every state and almost every county of our country during the past year you have carry the credit system of the nation safely through a most difficult crisis in this success you have demonstrate not alone the soundness of the credit system but also the capacity of our banker in emergency
 we have have a severe shock and there have be disorganization in our economic system which have temporarily check the march of prosperity but the fundamental asset of the nation the education intelligence virility and the spiritual strength of our 120 million people have be unimpaire the resource of our country in land and mine be undiminishe scientific discovery and invention have make further progress the gigantic equipment and unparalleled organization for production and distribution be in many part even strong than 2 year ago
 though our production and consumption have be slow down to 85 or 90 percent of normal yet by the very fact of the steady functioning of the major portion of our system do we have the assurance of our ability and the economic strength to overcome the decline the problem today be to complete the restoration of order in our rank and to intensify our effort to prevent such interruption for the future
 and it be not a problem in academic economic it be a great human problem the margin of shrinkage bring loss of saving unemployment privation hardship and fear which be no part of our ideal for the american economic system
 this depression be worldwide its cause and its effect lie only partly in the united states our country engage in overspeculation in security which crash a year ago with great loss a perhaps even large immediate cause of our depression have be the effect upon we from the collapse in price follow overproduction of important raw material mostly in foreign country particularly have the planting of rubber coffee wheat sugar and to a less extent cotton expand beyond world consumption even in normal time the production of certain metal such as silver copper and zinc have likewise be overexpande
 these major over expansion have take place largely outside of the united states their collapse have reduce the buying power of many country the prosperity of brazil and colombia have be temporarily affect from the situation in coffee chile peru mexico and australia from the fall in silver zinc and copper the buying power of india and china dependent upon the price of silver have be affect australia canada and the argentine have be affect by the situation in wheat cuba and java have be depress by the condition of the sugar industry east india generally have suffer from the fall in rubber these and other cause have produce in some of the country affect some political unrest these economic disturbance have echo in slow down demand for manufacture good from europe and ourselves with inevitable contribution to unemployment but the readjustment in price which be also inevitable be far along their course most of these commodity be below the level at which sufficient production can be maintain for the world&#39;s normal need and therefore soon or later must recover
 because the present depression be worldwide and because its cause be worldwide do not require that we should wait upon the recovery of the rest of the world we can make a very large degree of recovery independently of what may happen elsewhere
 i should like to remind you that we do precisely that thing in 1922 we be then experience the result of the collapse of war inflation in all commodity and in every direction we have less organized cooperation between the business community and the government to help mitigate that situation the rest of the world be in chaos from the war far more menacing both to economic and political stability than anything confront we today our difficulty at that time be far more severe than they be at present the commercial bank particularly be sufferer from a large volume of frozen credit and enjoy nothing to compare with the comfortable liquidity that prevail today we then have overexpansion and large stock in most commodity today with one or two exception we be free from this deterrent but we lead the world in recovery it be our independent recuperation from that depression and the economic strength which we so liberally and largely furnish to other country that be the very basis for reconstruction of a war demoralize world
 we be able in considerable degree to free ourselves of world influence and make a large measure of independent recovery because we be so remarkably self contain because of this while our economic system be subject to the shock of world influence we should be able in large measure to readjust ourselves our national production be over one third of the total of the whole commercial world we consume an average of about 90 percent of our own production of commodity if for example we assume a restore normal home consumption and hold even our present reduce basis of export we should be upon a 97 percent of normal business basis even this illustration do not represent all of our self contain strength
 we shall need mainly to depend upon our own strong arm for recovery as other nation be in great difficulty than we we shall need again to undertake to assist and cooperate with they our import of commodity in the main depend upon our domestic prosperity any forward movement in our recovery create a demand for foreign raw material and good and thus instantly react to assist other country the world over
 i wish to take your time to discuss some of the pivotal relationship of the banker not only to the immediate problem of recovery but to the wide problem of long view business stability any discussion of the one involve the other
 before i enter upon that subject however i wish to say that no one can occupy the high office of president and conceivably be other than completely confident of the future of the united states perhaps as to no other place do the cheerful courage and power of a confident people reflect as to his office there be a few folk in business and several folk in the political world who resent the notion that thing will ever get well and who wish to enjoy our temporary misery to recount to these person the progress of cooperation between the people and the government in amelioration of this situation or to mention that we be suffer far less than other country or that saving be pile up in the bank or that our people be pay off installment purchase that abundant capital be now press for new venture and employment only inspire the unkind retort that we should fix our gaze solely upon the unhappy feature of the decline and above all to chide the pessimism of person who have assume the end of those mighty force which for 150 year have drive this land far and far toward that great human goal the abolition of intellectual and economic poverty be perhaps not a sympathetic approach nevertheless i always have be and i remain an unquenchable believer in the resistless dynamic power of american enterprise this be no time an audience of american leader of business be no place to talk of any surrender we have know a thousand temporary setback but the spirit of this people will never brook defeat
 our present situation be not a new experience these interruption to the orderly march of progress have be recurrent for a century and apart from recovery from the present depression the most urgent undertaking in our economic life be to devise further method of prevent these storm we must assure a high degree of business stability for the future
 the cause advanced for these movement be many and varied there be no simple explanation this be not an occasion for analysis of the many theory such as too little gold or the inflexible use of it whatever the remote cause may be a large and immediate cause of most hard time be inflationary boom these strike some segment of economic life somewhere in the world and their reechoing destructive result bring depression and hard time these inflation in currency or credit in land or security or overexpansion in some sort of commodity production beyond possible demand even in good time may take place at home or abroad but they all bring retribution
 the leader of business of economic thought and of government have for the last decade give earnest search into cause and remedy of this sort of instability much have already be accomplish to check the violence of the storm and to mitigate their distress as a result of these effort the period of stable prosperity between storm be long the period of storm be short and the relief work far more effective but we need not go beyond our situation today to confirm the need for further effort
 the economic fatalist believe that these crisis be inevitable and bind to be recurrent i would remind these pessimist that exactly the same thing be once say of typhoid cholera and smallpox if medical science have sit down in a spirit of weak kneed resignation and accept these scourge as uncontrollable visitation of providence we should still have they with we this be not the spirit of modern science science gird itself with painstaking research to find the nature and origin of disease and to devise method for its prevention that should be our attitude toward these economic pestilence they be not dispensation of providence i be confident in the faith that their control so far as the cause lie within our own boundary be within the genius of modern business
 we have all be much engage with measure of relief from the effect of the collapse of a year ago at that time i determine that it be my duty even without precedent to call upon the business of the country for coordinated and constructive action to resist the force of disintegration the business community the banker labor and the government have cooperate in wide spread measure of mitigation than have ever be attempt before our banker and the reserve system have carry the country through the credit storm without impairment our lead business concern have sustain wage have distribute employment have expedite heavy construction the government have expand public work assist in credit to agriculture and have restrict immigration these measure have maintain a high degree of consumption than would have otherwise be the case they have thus prevent a large measure of unemployment they have provide much new employment our present experience in relief should form the basis of even more amplified plan in the future but in the long view the equally important thing be prevention we would need have less concern about what to do in bad time if we discover and erect in good time further safeguard against the excess which lead to these depression
 american business have prove its capacity to solve some great human problem in economic the relation between employer and employee have here reach a more stable and satisfactory basis than anywhere else in the world we have largely solve the problem of how to secure the consumption of the gigantic increase of good produce through that multiplication of per capita production by the application of science and the use of laborsave device that solution have be attain by share the saving in production cost between labor capital and the consumer through increase wage and salary to the worker and decrease price to the consumer with consequent increase buying power for still more good every step in that solution be a revolution from the old theory of business
 we may safely assume that our economic future be safe so far as it be dependent upon a competent handling of problem of productivity but one result be to render further advance toward stability even more urgent because with high standard of live the whole system be more sensitive and the penalty of instability more widespread
 there be no one group of which the public expect so much in assure stability as the banker because in the vortex of these storm many value lose their mooring nor can any other group contribute so much in constructive thought and action to solve the problem either today or in the long run
 three most important relationship to these business movement lie in the banker&#39;s field the first be what for lack of well term we call psychology both that contagious overoptimism which accelerate the inflation of the boom and those depth of fear and pessimism which deepen and prolong the depression the american banker have come to occupy a unique position in the strategy of stability for he be the economic adviser of american business he be the listen post of economic movement he in large measure make or temper its psychology
 i do not suppose the banker have consciously seek this new function of general adviser but such he have become his business be no long the simple function of discount commercial bill and lend money on first mortgage that is today but part of his work these day when he establish a line of credit to a business or furnish loan upon security of a business or advise investment in a business he must know the element which make for success and failure of that business and he must form judgment as to the future trend of business in general on the other side the american businessman big and little the farmer and the labor leader be come more and more to consult with the banker on problem of his business whatever the origin of his position may be the banker be now the economic guide philosopher and friend of his customer and his philosophy can dampen our enthusiasm and equally it can lift our courage and hope
 the second point of the banker&#39;s unique position in relation to business trend lie in the part which credit play in the whole business process obviously during the inflationary period the use of credit for unwise expansion and speculation draw away the supply of credit from normal business it impose upon normal business an interest rate which strangle the orderly commerce of the country commerce sicken under this pressure its pace slacken and contribute to collapse therefore i wish to emphasize what have long be recognize that be that the flow of credit can accelerate and it can retard such movement equally a wise direction of credit provide a large contribution to recovery from depression
 the third reason why this be so much a banker&#39; problem be that banking be the one great line of business activity that be in itself interconnect each credit institution share the credit burden of other and all be largely coordinate through national organization the federal reserve system
 the reserve system and its member bank and the treasury participation in fact form a widespread cooperative organization act in the broad interest of the whole people to a large degree it can influence the flow of credit banker themselves be represent at each stage of management and in addition the various board and advisory committee represent also industry agriculture merchandising and the government the reserve system therefore furnish an admirable center for cooperation of the banking business with the production and distribution industry and the government in the development of broad and detached policy of business stability
 you have gain much experience from the two great crisis of recent year i trust you will seriously and systematically consider what far effective measure can be take either in the business world or in cooperation with the government in development of such policy both for the present depression and for the future i know of no great public service it be a service to every businessman to every farmer to every worker whether at the desk or bench i be not assume you can do it all or that all disturbance domestic or foreign can be wholly prevent or cure
 the government should cooperate it play a large part in the credit structure of the country its fiscal system have most important bearing for instance i believe an inquiry might develop that our system of taxis upon capital gain directly encourage inflation by strangle the free movement of land and security
 the regulatory function of the federal and state government also have a bearing on this subject through their effect upon the financial strength of the railway and utility during a period of depression the sound and most available method of relief to unemployment be expansion of public work and construction in the utility railway and heavy industry the volume of possible expansion of construction in these private industry be about four or five time that in public work during the present depression these industry have do their full part but especially the railway have be handicap by some provision of the transportation act of 1920 with wide public vision the railway could be strengthen into a great balance wheel of stability we have nee to consider all of our economic legislation whether banking utility or agriculture or anything else from the point of view of its effect upon business stability
 i have never believe that our form of government could satisfactorily solve economic problem by direct action could successfully conduct business institution the government can and must cure abuse what the government can do well be to encourage and assist in the creation and development of institution control by our citizen and evolve by themselves from their own need and their own experience and direct in a sense of a trusteeship of public interest the federal reserve be such an institution
 without intrusion the government can sometimes give leadership and serve to bring together divergent element and secure cooperation in development of idea measure and institution that be a reenforcement of our individualism it do not cripple the initiative and enterprise of our people by the substitution of government
 proper cooperation among our people in public interest and continuation of such institutional growth strengthen the whole foundation of the nation for self government outside of political government be the true form of self government it be in this manner that these problem should be meet and solve
 i wish to revert to the influence of the banker through encouragement and leadership in expedition of our recovery from the present situation you have already do much and at this juncture the responsibility of those in control of money and credit be very great without faith on your part and without your good office the early return to full prosperity can not be accomplish this depression will be shorten largely to the degree that you feel that you can prudently by counsel and specific assistance instill into your client from industry agriculture and commerce a feeling of assurance
 we know that one of the prerequisite of end a depression be an ample supply of credit at low rate of interest this supply and these rate be now available through the cooperation of the bank and the federal reserve system
 the income of a large part of our people be not reduce by the depression but it be affect by unnecessary fear and pessimism the result of which be to slacken the consumption of good and discourage enterprise here the very atmosphere of your office will affect the mental attitude and if you please courage of the individual who will depend upon you for both counsel and money many perhaps all of you have be through other period of depression those of you who have have occasion to review the experience of the past will i believe join in the thought that there come a time in every depression when the change attitude of the financial agency can help the upward movement in our economic force
 i start with the premise that this question of stability be much more than a problem in academic economic it be a great human problem for it involve the happiness of million of home a continued unity of effort both in our present situation and in establish safeguard for the future be the need of today no one can contribute more than our banking community
 it appear from the press that someone suggest in your discussion that our american standard of living should be lower to that i emphatically disagree i do not believe it represent the view of this association not only do i not accept such a theory but on the contrary the whole purpose and ideal of this economic system which be distinctive of our country be to increase the standard of living by the adoption and the constantly widen diffusion of invention and discovery amongst the whole of our people any retreat from our american philosophy of constantly increase standard of living become a retreat into perpetual unemployment and the acceptance of a cesspool of poverty for some large part of our people
 our economic system be but an instrument of the social advancement of the american people it be an instrument by which we add to the security and richness of life of every individual it by no means comprise the whole purpose of life but it be the foundation upon which can be build the fine thing of the spirit increase in enrichment must be the objective of the nation not decrease
 in conclusion i would again profess my own undaunted faith in those mighty spiritual and intellectual force of liberty self government initiative invention and courage which have throughout our whole national life motivate our progress and drive we ever forward these force which express the true genius of our people be undiminishe they have already show their ability to resist this immediate shock any recession in american business be but a temporary halt in the prosperity of a great people

to the senate and house of representatives
 i have the honor to comply with the requirement of the constitution that i should lay before the congress information as to the state of the union and recommend consideration of such measure as be necessary and expedient
 substantial progress have be make during the year in national peace and security the fundamental strength of the nation&#39;s economic life be unimpaire education and scientific discovery have make advance our country be more alive to its problem of moral and spiritual welfare
 economic situation
 during the past 12 month we have suffer with other nation from economic depression
 the origin of this depression lie to some extent within our own border through a speculative period which divert capital and energy into speculation rather than constructive enterprise have overspeculation in security be the only force operate we should have see recovery many month ago as these particular dislocation have generally readjust themselves
 other deep seat cause have be in action however chiefly the world wide overproduction beyond even the demand of prosperous time for such important basic commodity as wheat rubber coffee sugar copper silver zinc to some extent cotton and other raw material the cumulative effect of demoralize price fall of these important commodity in the process of adjustment of production to world consumption have produce financial crisis in many country and have diminish the buying power of these country for import good to a degree which extend the difficulty far afield by create unemployment in all the industrial nation the political agitation in asia revolution in south america and political unrest in some european states the method of sale by russia of her increase agricultural export to european market and our own drought have all contribute to prolong and deepen the depression
 in the large view the major force of the depression now lie outside of the united states and our recuperation have be retard by the unwarranted degree of fear and apprehension create by these outside force
 the extent of the depression be indicate by the follow approximate percentage of activity during the past three month as compare with the highly prosperous year of 1928
 value of department store sale 93 of 1928
 volume of manufacture production 80 of 1928
 volume of mineral production 90 of 1928
 volume of factory employment 84 of 1928
 total of bank deposit 105 of 1928
 wholesale price all commodity 83 of 1928
 cost of live 94 of 1928
 various other index indicate total decrease of activity from 1928 of from 15 to 20 per cent
 there be many factor which give encouragement for the future the fact that we be hold from 80 to 85 per cent of our normal activity and income that our major financial and industrial institution have come through the storm unimpaire that price level of major commodity have remain approximately stable for some time that a number of industry be show sign of increase demand that the world at large be readjust itself to the situation all reflect ground for confidence we should remember that these occasion have be meet many time before that they be but temporary that our country be to day strong and rich in resource in equipment in skill than ever in its history we be in an extraordinary degree self sustain we will overcome world influence and will lead the march of prosperity as we have always do hitherto
 economic depression can not be cure by legislative action or executive pronouncement economic wound must be heal by the action of the cell of the economic body the producer and consumer themselves recovery can be expedite and its effect mitigate by cooperative action that cooperation require that every individual should sustain faith and courage that each should maintain his self reliance that each and every one should search for method of improve his business or service that the vast majority whose income be unimpaired should not hoard out of fear but should pursue their normal living and recreation that each should seek to assist his neighbor who may be less fortunate that each industry should assist its own employee that each community and each state should assume its full responsibility for organization of employment and relief of distress with that sturdiness and independence which build a great nation
 our people be respond to these impulse in remarkable degree the good contribution of government lie in encouragement of this voluntary cooperation in the community the government national state and local can join with the community in such program and do its part a year ago i together with other officer of the government initiate extensive cooperative measure throughout the country
 the first of these measure be an agreement of lead employer to maintain the standard of wage and of labor leader to use their influence against strife in a large sense these undertaking have be adhere to and we have not witness the usual reduction of wage which have always heretofore marked depression the index of union wage scale show they to be today fully up to the level of any of the previous three year in consequence the buying power of the country have be much large than would otherwise have be the case of equal importance the nation have have unusual peace in industry and freedom from the public disorder which have characterize previous depression
 the second direction of cooperation have be that our government national state and local the industry and business so distribute employment as to give work to the maximum number of employee
 the third direction of cooperation have be to maintain and even extend construction work and betterment in anticipation of the future it have be the universal experience in previous depression that public work and private construction have fall off rapidly with the general tide of depression on this occasion however the increase authorization and generous appropriation by the congress and the action of states and municipality have result in the expansion of public construction to an amount even above that in the most prosperous year in addition the cooperation of public utility railway and other large organization have be generously give in construction and betterment work in anticipation of future need the department of commerce advise i that as a result the volume of this type of construction work which amount to roughly $ 6,300,000,000 in 1929 instead of decrease will show a total of about $ 7,000,000,000 for 1930 there have of course be a substantial decrease in the type of construction which could not be undertake in advance of need
 the fourth direction of cooperation be the organization in such state and municipality as be deem necessary of committee to organize local employment to provide for employment agency and to effect relief of distress
 the result of magnificent cooperation throughout the country have be that actual suffering have be keep to a minimum during the past 12 month and our unemployment have be far less in proportion than in other large industrial country some time ago it become evident that unemployment would continue over the winter and would necessarily be add to from seasonal cause and that the saving of workpeople would be more largely deplete we have as a nation a definite duty to see that no deserve person in our country suffer from hunger or cold i therefore set up a more extensive organization to stimulate more intensive cooperation throughout the country there have be a most gratifying degree of response from governor mayor and other public official from welfare organization and from employer in concern both large and small the local community through their voluntary agency have assume the duty of relieve individual distress and be be generously support by the public
 the number of those wholly out of employment seek for work be accurately determine by the census last april as about 2,500,000 the department of labor index of employment in the large trade show some decrease in employment since that time the problem from a relief point of view be somewhat less than the publish estimate of the number of unemployed would indicate the intensive community and individual effort in provide special employment outside the list industry be not reflect in the statistical index and tend to reduce such publish figure moreover there be estimate to be a constant figure at all time of nearly 1,000,000 unemployed who be not without annual income but temporarily idle in the shift from one job to another we have an average of about three breadwinner to each two family so that every person unemployed do not represent a family without income the view that the relief problem be less than the gross number would indicate be confirm by the experience of several city which show that the number of family in distress represent from 10 to 20 per cent of the number of the calculate unemployed this be not say to minimize the very real problem which exist but to weigh its actual proportion
 as a contribution to the situation the federal government be engage upon the great program of waterway harbor flood control public building highway and airway improvement in all our history this together with loan to merchant shipbuilder improvement of the navy and in military aviation and other construction work of the government will exceed $ 520,000,000 for this fiscal year this compare with $ 253,000,000 in the fiscal year 1928 the construction work already authorize and the continuation of policy in government aid will require a continual expenditure upwards of half a billion dollar annually
 i favor still further temporary expansion of these activity in aid to unemployment during this winter the congress will however have present to it number of project some of they under the guise of rather than the reality of their usefulness in the increase of employment during the depression there be certain commonsense limitation upon any expansion of construction work the government must not undertake work that be not of sound economic purpose and that have not be subject to search technical investigation and which have not be give adequate consideration by the congress the volume of construction work in the government be already at the maximum limit warrant by financial prudence as a continue policy to increase taxation for purpose of construction work defeat its own purpose as such taxis directly diminish employment in private industry again any kind of construction require after its authorization a considerable time before labor can be employ in which to make engineering architectural and legal preparation our immediate problem be the increase of employment for the next six month and new plan which do not produce such immediate result or which extend commitment beyond this period be not warrant
 the enlarged river and harbor public building and highway plan authorize by the congress last session however offer an opportunity for assistance by the temporary acceleration of construction of these program even fast than originally plan especially if the technical requirement of the law which entail great delay could be amend in such fashion as to speed up acquirement of land and the letting of contract
 with view however to the possible need for acceleration we immediately upon receive those authority from the congress five month ago begin the necessary technical work in preparation for such possible eventuality i have canvass the department of the government as to the maximum amount that can be properly add to our present expenditure to accelerate all construction during the next six month and i feel warrant in ask the congress for an appropriation of from $ 100,000,000 to $ 150,000,000 to provide such further employment in this emergency in connection therewith we need some authority to make enlarge temporary advance of federal highway aid to the states
 i recommend that this appropriation be make distributable to the different department upon recommendation of a committee of the cabinet and approval by the president its application to work already authorize by the congress assure its use in direction of economic importance and to public welfare such action will imply an expenditure upon construction of all kind of over $ 650,000,000 during the next twelve month
 agriculture
 the world wide depression have affect agriculture in common with all other industry the average price of farm produce have fall to about 80 per cent of the level of 1928 this average be however greatly affect by wheat and cotton which have participate in world wide overproduction and have fall to about 60 per cent of the average price of the year 1928 exclude these commodity the price of all other agricultural product be about 84 per cent of those of 1928 the average wholesale price of other primary good such as nonferrous metal have fall to 76 per cent of 1928
 the price level of our major agricultural commodity be in fact high than those in other principal produce country due to the combine result of the tariff and the operation of the farm board for instance wheat price at minneapolis be about 30 per cent high than at winnipeg and at chicago they be about 20 per cent high than at buenos aires corn price at chicago be over twice as high as at buenos aires wool price average more than 80 per cent high in this country than abroad and butter be 30 per cent high in new york city than in copenhagen
 aside from the misfortune to agriculture of the world wide depression we have have the most severe drought it have affect particularly the states border on the potomac ohio and lower mississippi rivers with some area in montana kansas oklahoma and texas it have find its major expression in the shortage of pasturage and a shrinkage in the corn crop from an average of about 2,800,000,000 bushel to about 2,090,000,000 bushel
 on august 14 i call a conference of the governor of the most acutely affected states and as a result of its conclusion i appoint a national committee comprise the head of the important federal agency under the chairmanship of the secretary of agriculture the governor in turn have appoint state committee representative of the farmer banker business man and the red cross and subsidiary committee have be establish in most of the acutely affect county railway rate be reduce on feed and livestock in and out of the drought area and over 50,000 car of such product have be transport under these reduce rate the red cross establish a preliminary fund of $ 5,000,000 for distress relief purpose and establish agency for its administration in each county of this fund less than $ 500,000 have be call for up to this time as the need will appear more largely during the winter the federal farm loan board have extend its credit facility and the federal farm board have give financial assistance to all affected cooperative
 in order that the government may meet its full obligation toward our countryman in distress through no fault of their own i recommend that an appropriation should be make to the department of agriculture to be loan for the purpose of seed and feed for animal its application should as hitherto in such loan be limit to a gross amount to any one individual and secure upon the crop
 the red cross can relieve the case of individual distress by the sympathetic assistance of our people
 finance of the government
 i shall submit the detailed financial position of the government with recommendation in the usual budget message i will at this time however mention that the budget estimate of receipt and expenditure for the current year be formulate by the treasury and the budget bureau at a time when it be impossible to forecast the severity of the business depression and have be most seriously affect by it at that time a surplus of about $ 123,000,000 be estimate for this fiscal year and tax reduction which affect the fiscal year to the extent of $ 75,000,000 be authorize by the congress thus reduce the estimate surplus to about $ 48,000,000 closely revise estimate now make by the treasury and the bureau of the budget of the tax postal and other receipt for the current fiscal year indicate a decrease of about $ 430,000,000 from the estimate of a year ago of which about $ 75,000,000 be due to tax reduction leave about $ 355,000,000 due to the depression moreover legislation enact by congress subsequent to the submission of the budget enlarge federal construction work to expand employment and for increase in veterans&#39 service and other item have increase expenditure during the current fiscal year by about $ 225,000,000
 thus the decrease of $ 430,000,000 in revenue and the increase of $ 225,000,000 in expenditure adversely change the original budget situation by about $ 655,000,000 this large sum be offset by the original estimate surplus a year ago of about $ 123,000,000 by the application of $ 185,000,000 of interest payment upon the foreign debt to current expenditure by arrangement of the farm board through repayment etc in consequence of which they reduce their net cash demand upon the treasury by $ 100,000,000 in this period and by about $ 67,000,000 economy and deferment bring about in the government thus reduce the practical effect of the change in the situation to an estimate deficit of about $ 180,000,000 for the present fiscal year i shall make suggestion for handle the present year deficit in the budget message but i do not favor encroachment upon the statutory reduction of the public debt
 while it will be necessary in public interest to far increase expenditure during the current fiscal year in aid to unemployment by speed up construction work and aid to the farmer affect by the drought i can not emphasize too strongly the absolute necessity to defer any other plan for increase of government expenditure the budget for 1932 fiscal year indicate estimate expenditure of about $ 4,054,000,000 include postal deficit the receipt be estimate at about $ 4,085,000,000 if the temporary tax reduction of last year be discontinue leave a surplus of only about $ 30,000,000 most rigid economy be therefore necessary to avoid increase in taxis
 national defense
 our army and navy be be maintain at a high state of efficiency under officer of high training and intelligence support by a devoted personnel of the rank and file the london naval treaty have bring important economy in the conduct of the navy the navy department will lay before the committee of the congress recommendation for a program of authorization of new construction which should be initiate in the fiscal year of 1932
 legislation
 this be the last session of the seventy first congress during its previous sitting it have complete a very large amount of important legislation notably the establishment of the federal farm board fix congressional reapportionment revision of the tariff include the flexible provision and a reorganization of the tariff commission reorganization of the radio commission reorganization of the federal power commission expansion of federal prison reorganization of parole and probation system in federal prison expansion of veterans&#39 hospital establishment of disability allowance to veteran consolidation of veteran activity consolidation and strengthening of prohibition enforcement activity in the department of justice organization of a narcotics bureau large expansion of river and harbor improvement substantial increase in federal highway enlargement of public building construction program and the ratification of the london naval treaty
 the congress have before it legislation partially complete in the last sitting in respect to muscle shoals bus regulation relief of congestion in the court reorganization of border patrol in prevention of smuggling law enforcement in the district of columbia and other subject
 it be desirable that these measure should be complete
 the short session do not permit of extensive legislative program but there be a number of question which if time do not permit action i recommend should be place in consideration by the congress perhaps through committee cooperate in some instance with the federal department with view to preparation for subsequent action among they be the follow subject
 electrical power
 i have in a previous message recommend effective regulation of interstate electrical power such regulation should preserve the independence and responsibility of the states
 railway
 we have determine upon a national policy of consolidation of the railway as a necessity of more stable and more economically operate transportation further legislation be necessary to facilitate such consolidation in the public interest we should strengthen the railway that they may meet our future need
 antitrust law
 i recommend that the congress institute an inquiry into some aspect of the economic working of these law i do not favor repeal of the sherman act the prevention of monopoly be of most vital public importance competition be not only the basis of protection to the consumer but be the incentive to progress however the interpretation of these law by the court the change in business especially in the economic effect upon those enterprise closely related to the use of the natural resource of the country make such an inquiry advisable the producer of these material assert that certain unfortunate result of wasteful and destructive use of these natural resource together with a destructive competition which impoverish both operator and worker can not be remedie because of the prohibitive interpretation of the antitrust law the well know condition of the bituminous coal industry be an illustration the people have a vital interest in the conservation of their natural resource in the prevention of wasteful practice in condition of destructive competition which may impoverish the producer and the wage earner and they have an equal interest in maintain adequate competition i therefore suggest that an inquiry be direct especially to the effect of the working of the antitrust law in these particular field to determine if these evil can be remedie without sacrifice of the fundamental purpose of these law
 capital gain tax
 it be urge by many thoughtful citizen that the peculiar economic effect of the income tax on so call capital gain at the present rate be to enhance speculative inflation and likewise impede business recovery i believe this to be the case and i recommend that a study be make of the economic effect of this tax and of its relation to the general structure of our income tax law
 immigration
 there be need for revision of our immigration law upon a more limited and more selective basis flexible to the need of the country
 under condition of current unemployment it be obvious that person come to the united states seek work would likely become either a direct or indirect public charge as a temporary measure the officer issue visa to immigrant have be in pursuance of the law instruct to refuse visa to applicant likely to fall into this class as a result the visa issue have decrease from an average of about 24,000 per month prior to restriction to a rate of about 7,000 during the last month these be largely prefer person under the law visa from mexico be about 250 per month compare to about 4,000 previous to restriction the whole subject require exhaustive reconsideration
 deportation of alien criminal
 i urge the strengthening of our deportation law so as to more fully rid ourselves of criminal alien furthermore thousand of person have enter the country in violation of the immigration law the very method of their entry indicate their objectionable character and our law abide foreign bear resident suffer in consequence i recommend that the congress provide method of strengthen the government to correct this abuse
 post office
 due to deferment of government building over many year previous administration have be compel to enter upon type of lease for secondary facility in large city some of which be objectionable as represent too high a return upon the value of the property to prevent the occasion for far uneconomic leasing i recommend that the congress authorize the building by the government of its own facility
 veterans
 the nation have generously expand its care for veteran the consolidation of all veterans&#39 activity into the veterans&#39 administration have produce substantial administrative economy the consolidation also bring emphasis to the inequality in service and allowance the whole subject be under study by the administrator and i recommend it should also be examine by the committee of the congress
 social service
 i urge further consideration by the congress of the recommendation i make a year ago look to the development through temporary federal aid of adequate state and local service for the health of child and the further stamp out of communicable disease particularly in the rural section the advance of scientific discovery method and social thought impose a new vision in these matter the drain upon the federal treasury be comparatively small the result both economic and moral be of the utmost importance
 general
 it be my belief that after the passing of this depression when we can examine it in retrospect we shall need to consider a number of other question as to what action may be take by the government to remove possible governmental influence which make for instability and to well organize mitigation of the effect of depression it be as yet too soon to constructively formulate such measure
 there be many administrative subject such as departmental reorganization extension of the civil service readjustment of the postal rate etc which at some appropriate time require the attention of the congress
 foreign relation
 our relation with foreign country have be maintain upon a high basis of cordiality and good will
 during the past year the london naval pact be complete approve by the senate and ratify by the government concern by this treaty we have abolish competition in the building of warship have establish the basis of parity of the united states with the strong of foreign power and have accomplish a substantial reduction in war vessel
 during the year there have be an extended political unrest in the world asia continue in disturbed condition and revolution have take place in brazil argentina peru and bolivia despite the jeopardy to our citizen and their property which naturally arise in such circumstance we have with the cooperation of the government concern be able to meet all such instance without friction
 we have resume normal relation with the new government of brazil argentina peru and bolivia immediately upon evidence that they be able to give protection to our citizen and their property and that they recognize their international obligation
 a commission which be support by the congress have complete its investigation and report upon our future policy in respect to haiti and prove of high value in secure the acceptance of these policy an election have be hold and a new government establish we have replace our high commissioner by a minister and have begin the gradual withdrawal of our activity with view to complete retirement at the expiration of the present treaty in 1935
 a number of arbitration and conciliation treaty have be complete or negotiate during the year and will be present for approval by the senate
 i shall in a special message lie before the senate the protocol cover the statute of the world court which have be revise to accord with the sense of previous senate reservation

the president say
 i observe that measure have be already introduce in congress and be have advocacy which if pass would impose an increase expenditure beyond the sum which i have recommend for the present and next fiscal year by a total of nearly $ 4,500 million and mostly under the guise of give relief of some kind or another the gross sum which i have recommend to carry on the essential function of the government include the extreme sum which can be apply by the federal government in actual emergency employment or relief and be the maximum which can be finance without increase in taxis
 no matter how devise an increase in taxis in the end fall upon the worker and farmer or alternatively deprive industry of that much ability to give employment and defeat the very purpose of these scheme for the government to finance by bond issue deprive industry and agriculture of just that much capital for its own use and for employment prosperity can not be restore by raid upon the public treasury
 the leader of both party be cooperate to prevent any such event some of these scheme be ill consider some represent enthusiast and some represent the desire of individual to show that they be more generous than the administration or that they be more generous than even the leader of their own party they be play politic at the expense of human misery
 many of these measure be be promote by organization and agency outside of congress and be push upon member of congress some of they be mistake as to the result they will accomplish and they be all mistake as to the ability of the federal government to undertake such burden some of these outside agency be also engage in promote political purpose the american people will not be mislead by such tactic

the president say
 certain senators have issue a public statement to the effect that unless the president and the house of representatives agree to appropriation from the federal treasury for charitable purpose they will force an extra session of congress i do not wish to add acrimony to a discussion but would rather state this case as i see its fundamental
 this be not an issue as to whether people shall go hungry or cold in the united states it be solely a question of the good method by which hunger and cold shall be prevent it be a question as to whether the american people on one hand will maintain the spirit of charity and mutual self help through voluntary giving and the responsibility of local government as distinguish on the other hand from appropriation out of the federal treasury for such purpose my own conviction be strongly that if we break down this sense of responsibility of individual generosity to individual and mutual self help in the country in time of national difficulty and if we start appropriation of this character we have not only impair something infinitely valuable in the life of the american people but have strike at the root of self government once this have happen it be not the cost of a few score million but we be face with the abyss of reliance in future upon government charity in some form or other the money involve be indeed the least of the cost to american ideal and american institution
 president cleveland in 1887 confront with a similar issue state in part
 a prevalent tendency to disregard the limited mission of this power and duty should i think be steadfastly resist to the end that the lesson should be constantly enforce that though the people support the government the government should not support the people the friendliness and charity of our countryman can always be rely upon to relieve their fellow citizen in misfortune this have be repeatedly and quite lately demonstrate federal aid in such case encourage the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weaken the sturdiness of our national character while it prevent the indulgence among our people of that kindly sentiment and conduct which strengthen the bond of a common brotherhood
 and there be a practical problem in all this the help be daily extend by neighbor by local and national agency by municipality by industry and a great multitude of organization throughout the country today be many time any appropriation yet propose the opening of the door of the federal treasury be likely to stifle this giving and thus destroy far more resource than the propose charity from the federal government
 the basis of successful relief in national distress be to mobilize and organize the infinite number of agency of self help in the community that have be the american way of relieve distress among our own people and the country be successfully meet its problem in the american way today
 we have two entirely separate and distinct situation in the country the first be the drought area the second be the unemployment in our large industrial center for both of which these appropriation attempt to make charitable contribution
 immediately upon the appearance of the drought last august i convoke a meeting of the governors the red cross and the railway the banker and other agency in the country and lay the foundation of organization and the resource to stimulate every degree of self help to meet the situation which it be then obvious would develop the result of this action be to attack the drought problem in a number of direction the red cross establish committee in every drought county comprise the lead citizen of those county with instruction to they that they be to prevent starvation among their neighbor and if the problem go beyond local resource the red cross would support they
 the organization have stretch throughout the area of suffering the people be be care for today through the hand and with sympathetic understanding and upon the responsibility of their neighbor who be be support in turn by the fine spirit of mutual assistance of the american people the red cross official whose long devoted service and experience be unchallenged inform i this morning that except for the minor incident of any emergency organization no one be go hungry and no one need go hungry or cold
 to reinforce this work at the opening of congress i recommend large appropriation for loan to rehabilitate agriculture from the drought and provision of further large sum for public work and construction in the drought territory which would give employment in further relief to the whole situation these federal activity provide for an expenditure of upward of $ 100 million in this area and it be in progress today
 the red cross have always meet the situation which it have undertake after careful survey and after actual experience of several month with their part of the problem they have announce firmly that they can command the resource with which to meet any call for human relief in prevention of hunger and suffering in drought area and that they accept this responsibility they have refuse to accept federal appropriation as not be consonant either with the need or the character of their organization the government department have give and be give they every assistance we possibly need to strengthen the public health service in matter of sanitation and to strengthen the credit facility of that area through the method approve by the government department to divert some exist appropriation to strengthen agricultural credit corporation
 in the matter of unemployment outside of the drought area important economic measure of mutual self help have be develop such as those to maintain wage to distribute employment equitably to increase construction work by industry to increase federal construction work from a rate of about $ 275 million a year prior to the depression to a rate now of over $ 750 million a year to expand state and municipal construction all upon a scale never before provide or even attempt in any depression but beyond this to assure that there shall be no suffering in every town and county voluntary agency in relief of distress have be strengthen and create and generous fund have be place at their disposal they be carry on their work efficiently and sympathetically
 but after and coincidently with voluntary relief our american system require that municipal county and state government shall use their own resource and credit before seek such assistance from the federal treasury
 i have indeed spend much of my life in fight hardship and starvation both abroad and in the southern states i do not feel that i should be charge with lack of human sympathy for those who suffer but i recall that in all the organization with which i have be connect over these many year the foundation have be to summon the maximum of self help i be proud to have seek the help of congress in the past for nation who be so disorganized by war and anarchy that self help be impossible but even these appropriation be but a tithe of that which be coincidently mobilize from the public charity of the united states and foreign country there be no such paralysis in the united states and i be confident that our people have the resource the initiative the courage the stamina and kindliness of spirit to meet this situation in the way they have meet their problem over generation
 i will accredit to those who advocate federal charity a natural anxiety for the people of their states i be willing to pledge myself that if the time should ever come that the voluntary agency of the country together with the local and state government be unable to find resource with which to prevent hunger and suffering in my country i will ask the aid of every resource of the federal government because i would no more see starvation amongst our countryman than would any senator or congressman i have the faith in the american people that such a day will not come
 the american people be do their job today they should be give a chance to show whether they wish to preserve the principle of individual and local responsibility and mutual self help before they embark on what i believe be a disastrous system i feel sure they will succeed if give the opportunity
 the whole business situation would be greatly strengthen by the prompt completion of the necessary legislation of this session of congress and thereby the unemployment problem would be lessen the drought area indirectly benefit and the resource of self help in the country strengthen

to the house of representatives
 i return herewith without my approval h.r. 17054 an act to increase the loan basis of adjusted service certificate
 in order that it may be clearly understand i may review that the adjusted compensation act bonus bill pass on may 19 1924 award to 3,498,000 veteran approximately $ 1,365,000,000 further compensation for war service to this sum be add 25 per cent say to be consideration for defer the payment until about 1945 the whole bearing 4 per cent compound interest immediate payment to dependent upon death be include thus create an endowment insurance policy represent by a certificate to each veteran show the sum payable at the end of the period the face value the total face value of the outstanding certificate to day after pay the sum due of less than $ 50 and payment in full to dependent be $ 3,426,000,000 hold by 3,397,000 veteran or an average of about $ 1,000 each
 the burden upon the country be to be an amount each year sufficient as a yearly premium to provide for the payment of the face value of these certificate in about 1945 and to date have involve an appropriation average $ 112,000,000 per annum the accumulation of these appropriation be represent by government obligation deposit in a reserve fund which fund now amount to about $ 750,000,000 a loan basis to certificate holder be establish equal to 90 per cent of the reserve value of the certificate such loan now in the sixth year be authorize to 221/2 per cent of the face value
 when the bonus act be pass it be upon the explicit understanding of the congress that the matter be close and the government would not be call upon to make subsequent enlargement it be now propose to enlarge the loan rate to 50 per cent of the face value at a low rate of interest thus impose a potential cash outlay upon the government of about $ 1,700,000,000 if all veteran apply for loan less about $ 330,000,000 already loan accord to the administrator of veterans&#39 affair the probable number who will avail themselves of the privilege under this bill will require approximately $ 1,000,000,000 there not be a penny in the treasury to meet such a demand the government must borrow this sum through the sale of the reserve fund security together with further issue or we must need impose further taxation
 the sole appeal make for the reopening of the bonus act be the claim that fund from the national treasury should be provide to veteran in distress as the result of the drought and business depression there be veteran unemployed and in need to day in common with many other of our people these like the other be be provide the basic necessity of life by the devoted committee in those part of the country affect by the depression or drought the government and many employer be give preference to veteran in employment their welfare be and should be a matter of concern to our people inquiry indicate that such care be be give throughout the country and it also indicate that the number of veteran in need of such relief be a minor percentage of the whole
 the utility of this legislation as relief to those in distress be far less than have be disclose the popular assumption have be that as the certificate average $ 1,000 then each veteran can obtain $ 500 by way of a loan but this be only an average and more than one half will receive less than this amount in fact over 800,000 man will be able to borrow less than $ 200 and of these over 200,000 will be able to borrow only an average of $ 75 furthermore there be 100,000 veteran whose certificate have be issue recently who under the propose law will have no loan privilege until their certificate be two year old it be therefore urgent in any event that local committee continue relief to veteran but this legislation would lead such local committee and employer to assume that these veteran have be provide for by the federal treasury and thereby threaten they with great hardship than before
 the breach of fundamental principle in this proposal be the requirement of the federal government to provide an enormous sum of money to a vast majority who be able to care for themselves and who be care for themselves
 among those who would receive the propose benefit be include 387,000 veteran and 400,000 dependent who be already receive some degree of allowance or support from the federal government but in addition to these it provide equal benefit for score of thousand of other who be in the income tax pay class and for score of thousand who be hold secure position in the federal state and local government and in every profession and industry i know that most of these man do not seek these privilege they have no desire to be present to the american people as benefit by a burden put upon the whole people and i have many manifestation from veteran on whom the time be bear hardly that they do not want to be represent to our people as a group substitute special privilege for the idealism and patriotism they have rejoice in offer to their country through their service
 it be suggest as a reason for make these provision applicable to all veteran that we should not make public distinction between veteran in need and the other who comprise the vast majority lest we characterize those deserving help as a pauper class on the contrary veteran in need be and should be a preferred class that a grateful country would be proud to honor with its support adoption of the principle of aid to the rich or to those able to support themselves in itself set up a group of special privilege among our citizen
 the principle that the nation should give generous care to those veteran who be ill disabled in need or in distress even though these disability do not arise from the war have be fully accept by the nation pension or allowance have be provide for the dependent of those who lose their life in the war allowance have be provide to those who suffer disability from the war additional allowance be pass at the last session of congress to all the veteran whose earn power at any time may be permanently impair by injury or illness free hospitalization be available not only to those suffer from the result of war but to large number of temporarily ill together with war risk insurance and the adjusted compensation these service now total an annual expenditure of approximately $ 600,000,000 and under exist law will increase to $ 800,000,000 per annum in a very few year for world war veteran alone a total of five thousand million of dollar have be expend upon such service since the war
 our country have thus show its sense of obligation and generosity and its readiness at all time to aid those of its veteran in need i have the utmost confidence that our service man would be amongst the first to oppose a policy of government assistance to veteran who have property and mean to support themselves for service man be as devoted to the welfare of our country in peace as in war and as clearly foresee the future danger of embark on such a policy it could but create resentment which would ultimately react against those who should be give care
 it be argue that the distribution of the hundred of million of dollar propose by this bill would stimulate business generally we can not further the restoration of prosperity by borrow from some of our people pledge the credit of all of the people to loan to some of our people who be not in need of the money if the exercise of these right be limit to expenditure upon necessity only there would be no stimulation to business the theory of stimulation be base upon the anticipation of wasteful expenditure it can be of no assistance in the return of real prosperity if this argument of proponent be correct we should make government loan to the whole people
 it be represent that this measure merely provide loan against a future obligation and that therefore it will cost the american people nothing that be an incomplete statement a cost at once arise to the people when instead of proceed by annual appropriation the government be force to secure a huge sum by borrow or otherwise especially in the circumstance of to day when we be compel in the midst of depression to make other large borrowing to cover deficit and refund operation an increase rate of interest which the government must pay upon all long term issue be inevitable it impose an additional burden of interest on the people which will extend through the whole term of such loan some cost arise to the people through the tendency to increase the interest rate which every state and municipality must pay in their borrowing for public work and improvement as well as the rate which industry and business must pay there be a cost to someone through the retardation of the speed of recovery of employment when government borrowing divert the saving of the people from their use by constructive industry and commerce it impose a great charge upon the individual who lose such increase employment or continue unemployed to the veteran this be a double loss when he have consume the value of his certificate and have also lose the opportunity for great earning there be a great cost than all this it be a step toward government aid to those who can help themselves these direct or indirect burden fall upon the people as a whole
 the need of our people to day be a decrease in the burden of taxis and unemployment yet they who include the veteran be be steadily force toward high tax level and lessen employment by such act as this we must not forget the million of hard work family in our country who be strive to pay the debt which they have incur in acquire home and farm in endeavor to build protection for their future they in the last analysis must bear the burden of increase government aid and taxis it be not the rich who suffer when we take employment and taxis from our people it be the poor who suffer
 there be a very serious phase of this matter for the wife and child of veteran and to the future security of veteran themselves each of these certificate be an endowment insurance policy any money advance against they together with its interest will be automatically deduct from the value of the certificate in case of death or upon maturity no one will deny that under the pressure or allurement of the moment many will borrow against these certificate for other than absolutely necessary purpose the loss to many family mean the destruction of the one safeguard at their most critical time it can not be contend that the interest of the family of our country be conserve by either cash or borrow upon their life insurance policy
 i have no desire to present monetary aspect of the question except so far as they affect the human aspect surely it be a human aspect to transfer to the back of those who toil include veteran a burden of those who by position and property can care for themselves it be a human aspect to incur the danger of continued or increased unemployment it be a human aspect to deprive woman and child of protection by reckless use of an endowment policy our country be rich enough to do any justice no country be rich enough to do an injustice
 the patriotism of our people be not a material thing it be a spiritual thing we can not pay for it with government aid we can honor those in need by our aid and it be a fundamental aspect of freedom among we that no step should be take which burden the nation with a privileged class who can care for themselves
 i regard the bill under consideration as unwise from the standpoint of the veteran themselves and unwise from the standpoint of the welfare of all the people the future of our world war veteran be inseparably bind up with the future of the whole people the great service that we can render both veteran and the public generally be to administer the affair of our government with a view to the well being and happiness of all of the nation
 the matter under consideration be of grave importance in itself but of much graver importance be the whole tendency to open the federal treasury to a thousand purpose many admirable in their intention but in which the proponent fail or do not care to see that with such beginning many of they insidiously consume more and more of the saving and the labor of our people in aggregate they threaten burden beyond the ability of our country normally to bear and of far high importance each of they break the barrier of self reliance and self support in our people

the president make the follow statement
 the american government propose the postponement during 1 year of all payment on intergovernmental debt reparation and relief debt both principal and interest of course not include obligation of government hold by private party subject to confirmation by congress the american government will postpone all payment upon the debt of foreign government to the american government payable during the fiscal year begin july 1 next conditional on a like postponement for 1 year of all payment on intergovernmental debt owe the important creditor power
 this course of action have be approve by the following senator henry f. ashurst hiram bingham william e. borah james f. byrnes arthur capper simeon d. fess duncan u. fletcher carter glass william j. harris pat harrison cordell hull william h. king dwight w. morrow george h. moses david a. reed claude a. swanson arthur vandenberg robert f. wagner david i. walsh thomas j. walsh james e. watson and by the follow representatives isaac bacharach joseph w. byrns carl r. chindblom frank crowther james w. collier charles r. crisp thomas h. cullen george p. darrow harry a. estep willis c. hawley carl e. mapes j. c. mclaughlin earl c. michener c. william ramseyer bertrand h. snell john q. tilson allen t. treadway and will r. wood it have be approve by ambassador charles g. dawes and by mr. owen d. young
 the purpose of this action be to give the forthcoming year to the economic recovery of the world and to help free the recuperative force already in motion in the united states from retarding influence from abroad
 the worldwide depression have affect the country of europe more severely than our own some of these country be feel to a serious extent the drain of this depression on national economy the fabric of intergovernmental debt supportable in normal time weigh heavily in the midst of this depression
 from a variety of cause arise out of the depression such as the fall in the price of foreign commodity and the lack of confidence in economic and political stability abroad there be an abnormal movement of gold into the united states which be lower the credit stability of many foreign country these and the other difficulty abroad diminish buying power for our export and in a measure be the cause of our continued unemployment and continue low price to our farmer
 wise and timely action should contribute to relieve the pressure of these adverse force in foreign country and should assist in the reestablishment of confidence thus forward political peace and economic stability in the world
 authority of the president to deal with this problem be limit as this action must be support by the congress it have be assure the cordial support of lead member of both party in the senate and the house the essence of this proposition be to give time to permit debtor government to recover their national prosperity i be suggest to the american people that they be wise creditor in their own interest and be good neighbor
 i wish to take this occasion also to frankly state my view upon our relation to german reparation and the debt owe to we by the allied governments of europe our government have not be a party to or exert any voice in determination of reparation obligation we purposely do not participate in either general reparation or the division of colony or property the repayment of debt due to we from the allies for the advance for war and reconstruction be settle upon a basis not contingent upon german reparation or related thereto therefore reparation be necessarily wholly a european problem with which we have no relation
 i do not approve in any remote sense of the cancellation of the debt to we world confidence would not be enhance by such action none of our debtor nation have ever suggest it but as the basis of the settlement of these debt be the capacity under normal condition of the debtor to pay we should be consistent with our own policy and principle if we take into account the abnormal situation now exist in the world i be sure the american people have no desire to attempt to extract any sum beyond the capacity of any debtor to pay and it be our view that broad vision require that our government should recognize the situation as it exist
 this course of action be entirely consistent with the policy which we have hitherto pursue we be not involve in the discussion of strictly european problem of which the payment of german reparation be one it represent our willingness to make a contribution to the early restoration of world prosperity in which our own people have so deep an interest
 i wish far to add that while this action have no bearing on the conference for limitation of land armament to be hold next february inasmuch as the burden of competitive armament have contribute to bring about this depression we trust that by this evidence of our desire to assist we shall have contribute to the good will which be so necessary in the solution of this major question

great britain&#39;s departure from the gold standard
 the president i have be ask by two of your member to discuss something of the british demonetization or departure from the gold standard i can only do that by way of background i can not make a public statement in the matter
 i think you will understand that this situation have be pende for a good many month there have be a large amount of british investment in the united states and that amount estimate by the department of commerce aggregate something over $ 1,500 million that be not flight of capital but steadily increase expenditure here which naturally affect the exchange it have take place not only in the past few month but for some year back that of course have affect the problem of exchange there have be some pile up of immediate cash in our bank from that quarter
 the course resolve upon by the british government create some temporary dislocation in the international world but they be due more to the confusion arise out of readjustment of quotation and value than in their effect on the value of either security or commodity
 the first effect of the decrease in the gold value of the pound be a rise in price of commodity in great britain at least in all international commodity where the price be make by international action such as in wheat and other raw material there be involve a large amount of transaction base on the readjustment of those price a certain amount of confusion come out of that and the effect on our commodity market have be a decrease in price there have be a rise in price in england in consequence and our price be practically unchanged yesterday and today
 the fact that the pound be take off its fix value of $ 4.86 be not the abandonment of the gold standard even for the pound as international commerce revolve in these day all transaction will be measure in some gold value whether in dollar franc gulden or any other of the fix gold currency no transaction can take place unless it have some basis of measurement of that character it really mean that the fix gold standard have be abandon and a variable standard adopt which may change momentarily but in any event all value in international commerce be bind to revolve on gold value or some measure stick in gold it be more or less a case of abandon a fix standard and adopt a variable one so far as international commerce be concern
 the effect in england will undoubtedly be to increase export which amount to price reduction compare with the standard of measurement in gold and it should act as a stimulant and thus should increase employment and increase the demand again for raw material obviously it amount to a reduction in standard of live temporarily in those commodity which be import of course raw material but wage and rank will lag behind production cost will be low and consequently export will be stimulate
 the tendency also may be to decrease import to some extent especially for highly competitive good on the export side the effect be not go to be very material on the united states because there be comparatively small volume of british and american good which be highly competitive in neutral market a study make some time ago of the argentine show that there be only about 10 percent of the export of the united states to the argentine and correspondingly 10 percent of the british export to the argentine that be competitive we be export good which we can peculiarly produce to the good advantage and it might mean competition in respect to that small fraction over toward the neutral market but it would not be any appreciable volume
 there might be some decrease in import into great britain especially in luxury but our trade with great britain consist largely of raw material and manufactured good if there be stimulation of british export our export would be more likely to increase than decrease i mention that only to indicate that the effect of it be not as far reach as some people may think
 on the financial side there be no consequential balance of american bank in england they will always have sufficient of their own capital so there be no loss there of any consequence at all all together the action no doubt necessary on the british side be not we feel go to have any great effect in the united states the probability be that it will considerably improve the situation in england and we will benefit in the long run in any event when there be a question pende over the world&#39;s economic life the actual realization of it be much less severe on we than be the constant possibility of it such as have be the case for the past 3 or 4 month all together if we be go to have an important economic shift it be well to have it over than to have it hang about
 you will realize also that this be not the first time that the pound have be off the gold basis i do not know of any nation in the world which manage to maintain through its national life the gold value of its currency there be a long period in the united states after the civil war when we certainly could not maintain it the pound be off the gold basis from some point in the war to 3 4 or 5 year afterwards but gradually the economic situation readjust itself these thing be temporary and go back again to their original position
 and that be all i have today

my fellow citizen
 this broadcast tonight mark the beginning of the mobilization of the whole nation for a great undertaking to provide security for those of our citizen and their family who through no fault of their own face unemployment and privation during the come winter its success depend upon the sympathetic and generous action of every man and woman in our country no one with a spark of human sympathy can contemplate unmove the possibility of suffering that can crush many of our unfortunate fellow americans if we shall fail they

to the senate and house of representatives
 it be my duty under the constitution to transmit to the congress information on the state of the union and to recommend for its consideration necessary and expedient measure
 the chief influence affect the state of the union during the past year have be the continued world wide economic disturbance our national concern have be to meet the emergency it have create for we and to lay the foundation for recovery
 if we lift our vision beyond these immediate emergency we find fundamental national gain even amid depression in meet the problem of this difficult period we have witness a remarkable development of the sense of cooperation in the community for the first time in the history of our major economic depression there have be a notable absence of public disorder and industrial conflict above all there be an enlargement of social and spiritual responsibility among the people the strain and stress upon business have result in close application in saner policy and in well method public improvement have be carry out on a large scale than even in normal time the country be rich in physical property in newly discover resource and in productive capacity than ever before there have be constant gain in knowledge and education there have be continuous advance in science and invention there have be distinct gain in public health business depression have be recurrent in the life of our country and be but transitory the nation have emerge from each of they with increase strength and virility because of the enlightenment they have bring the readjustment and the large understanding of the reality and obligation of life and work which come from they
 national defense
 both our army and navy have be maintain in a high state of efficiency the ability and devotion of both officer and man sustain the high tradition of the service reduction and postponement in expenditure of these department to meet the present emergency be be make without reduce exist personnel or impair the morale of either establishment
 the agreement between the lead naval power for limitation of naval armament and establishment of their relative strength and thus elimination of competitive building also imply for ourselves the gradual expansion of the deficient category in our navy to the parity provide in those treaty however none of the other nation party to these agreement be to day maintain the full rate of construction which the treaty size of fleet would imply
 although these agreement secure the maximum reduction of fleet which it be at that time possible to attain i be hopeful that the naval power party to these agreement will realize that establishment of relative strength in itself offer opportunity for further reduction without injury to any of they this would be the more possible if pende negotiation be successful between france and italy if the world be to regain its standard of life it must far decrease both naval and other arm the subject will come before the general disarmament conference which meet in geneva on february 2
 foreign affairs
 we be at peace with the world we have cooperate with other nation to preserve peace the right of our citizen abroad have be protect
 the economic depression have continue and deepen in every part of the world during the past year in many country political instability excessive armament debt governmental expenditure and taxis have result in revolution in unbalanced budget and monetary collapse and financial panic in dumping of good upon world market and in diminished consumption of commodity

 as our difficulty during the past year have plainly originate in large degree from these source any effort to bring about our own recuperation have dictate the necessity of cooperation by we with other nation in reasonable effort to restore world confidence and economic stability
 cooperation of our federal reserve system and our bank with the central bank in foreign country have contribute to localize and ameliorate a number of serious financial crisis or moderate the pressure upon we and thus avert disaster which would have affect we
 the economic crisis in germany and central europe last june rise to the dimension of a general panic from which it be apparent that without assistance these nation must collapse apprehension of such collapse have demoralize our agricultural and security market and so threaten other nation as to impose further danger upon we but of high importance be the necessity of cooperation on our part to relieve the people of germany from imminent disaster and to maintain their important relation to progress and stability in the world upon the initiative of this government a year&#39;s postponement of reparation and other intergovernmental debt be bring about upon our further initiative an agreement be make by germany&#39;s private creditor provide for an extension of such credit until the german people can develop more permanent and definite form of relief
 we have continue our policy of withdraw our marine from haiti and nicaragua

 the domestic situation
 many undertaking have be organize and forward during the past year to meet the new and change emergency which have constantly confront we
 broadly the community have cooperate to meet the need of honest distress and to take such emergency measure as would sustain confidence in our financial system and would cushion the violence of liquidation in industry and commerce thus give time for orderly readjustment of cost inventory and credit without panic and widespread bankruptcy these measure have serve those purpose and will promote recovery
 in these measure we have strive to mobilize and stimulate private initiative and local and community responsibility there have be the least possible government entry into the economic field and that only in temporary and emergency form our citizen and our local government have give a magnificent display of unity and action initiative and patriotism in solve a multitude of difficulty and in cooperate with the federal government
 for a proper understanding of my recommendation to the congress it be desirable very briefly to review such activity during the past year
 the emergency of unemployment have be meet by action in many direction the appropriation for the continue speeding up of the great federal construction program have provide direct and indirect aid to employment upon a large scale by organized unity of action the states and municipality have also maintain large program of public improvement many industry have be prevail upon to anticipate and intensify construction industrial concern and other employer have be organize to spread available work amongst all their employee instead of discharge a portion of they a large majority have maintain wage at as high level as the safe conduct of their business would permit this course have save we from industrial conflict and disorder which have characterize all previous depression immigration have be curtail by administrative action upon the basis of normal immigration the decrease amount to about 300,000 individual who otherwise would have be add to our unemployment the expansion of federal employment agency under appropriation by the congress have prove most effective through the president&#39;s organization for unemployment relief public and private agency be successfully mobilize last winter to provide employment and other measure against distress similar organization give assurance against suffer during the come winter committee of lead citizen be now active at practically every point of unemployment in the large majority they have be assure the fund necessary which together with local government aid will meet the situation a few exceptional locality will be far organize the evidence of the public health service show an actual decrease of sickness and infant and general mortality below normal year no great proof could be adduce that our people have be protect from hunger and cold and that the sense of social responsibility in the nation have respond to the need of the unfortunate
 to meet the emergency in agriculture the loan authorize by congress for rehabilitation in the drought area have enable farmer to produce abundant crop in those district the red cross undertake and magnificently administer relief for over 2,500,000 drought sufferer last winter it have undertake this year to administer relief to 100,000 sufferer in the new drought area of certain northwest states the action of the federal farm board in grant credit to farm cooperative save many of they from bankruptcy and increase their purpose and strength by enable farm cooperative to cushion the fall in price of farm product in 1930 and 1931 the board secure high price to the farmer than would have be obtain otherwise although the benefit of this action be partially defeat by continue world overproduction incident to this action the failure of a large number of farmer and of country bank be avert which could quite possibly have spread into a major disaster the bank in the south have cooperate with the farm board in creation of a pool for the well marketing of accumulate cotton grower have be materially assist by this action constant effort have be make to reduce overproduction in relief of agriculture and to promote the foreign buying of agricultural product by sustain economic stability abroad
 to meet our domestic emergency in credit and banking arise from the reaction to acute crisis abroad the national credit association be set up by the bank with resource of $ 500,000,000 to support sound bank against the frightened withdrawal and hoarding it be give aid to reopen solvent bank which have be close federal official have bring about many beneficial union of bank and have employ other mean which have prevent many bank closing as a result of these measure the hoarding withdrawal which have rise to over $ 250,000,000 per week after the british crisis have substantially cease
 further measures
 the major economic force and weakness at home and abroad have now be expose and can be appraise and the time be ripe for forward action to expedite our recovery
 although some of the cause of our depression be due to speculation inflation of security and real estate unsound foreign investment and mismanagement of financial institution yet our self contain national economy with its matchless strength and resource would have enable we to recover long since but for the continued dislocation shock and setback from abroad
 whatever the cause may be the vast liquidation and readjustment which have take place have leave we with a large degree of credit paralysis which together with the situation in our railway and the condition abroad be now the outstanding obstacle to recuperation if we can put our financial resource to work and can ameliorate the financial situation in the railway i be confident we can make a large measure of recovery independent of the rest of the world a strong america be the high contribution to world stability
 one phase of the credit situation be indicate in the bank during the past year bank represent 3 per cent of our total deposit have be close a large part of these failure have be cause by withdrawal for hoarding as distinguish from the failure early in the depression where weakness due to mismanagement be the large cause of failure despite their closing many of they will pay in full although such withdrawal have practically cease yet $ 1,100,000,000 of currency be previously withdraw which have still to return to circulation this represent a large reduction of the ability of our bank to extend credit which would otherwise fertilize industry and agriculture furthermore many of our banker in order to prepare themselves to meet possible withdrawal have felt compel to call in loan to refuse new credit and to realize upon security which in turn have demoralize the market the paralysis have be far augment by the steady increase in recent year of the proportion of bank asset invest in long term security such as mortgage and bond these security tend to lose their liquidity in depression or temporarily to fall in value so that the ability of the bank to meet the shock of sudden withdrawal be greatly lessen and the restriction of all kind of credit be thereby increase the continue credit paralysis have operate to accentuate the deflation and liquidation of commodity real estate and security below any reasonable basis of value
 all of this tend to stifle business especially the small unit and finally express itself in further depression of price and value in restriction on new enterprise and in increase unemployment
 the situation largely arise from an unjustified lack of confidence we have enormous volume of idle money in the bank and in hoarding we do not require more money or working capital we need to put what we have to work
 the fundamental difficulty which have bring about financial strain in foreign country do not exist in the united states no external drain on our resource can threaten our position because the balance of international payment be in our favor we owe less to foreign country than they owe to we our industry be efficiently organize our currency and bank deposit be protect by the great gold reserve in history
 our first step toward recovery be to reestablish confidence and thus restore the flow of credit which be the very basis of our economic life we must put some steel beam in the foundation of our credit structure it be our duty to apply the full strength of our government not only to the immediate phase but to provide security against shock and the repetition of the weakness which have be prove
 the recommendation which i here lie before the congress be design to meet these need by strengthen financial industrial and agricultural life through the medium of our exist institution and thus to avoid the entry of the government into competition with private business
 federal government finance
 the first requirement of confidence and of economic recovery be financial stability of the united states government i shall deal with fiscal question at great length in the budget message but i must at this time call attention to the magnitude of the deficit which have develop and the result necessity for determined and courageous policy these deficit arise in the main from the heavy decrease in tax receipt due to the depression and to the increase in expenditure on construction in aid to unemployment aid to agriculture and upon service to veteran
 during the fiscal year end june 30 last we incur a deficit of about $ 903,000,000 which include the statutory reduction of the debt and represent an increase of the national debt by $ 616,000,000 of this however $ 153,000,000 be offset by increase cash balance
 in comparison with the fiscal year 1928 there be indicate a fall in federal receipt for the present fiscal year amount to $ 1,683,000,000 of which $ 1,034,000,000 be in individual and corporate income taxis alone during this fiscal year there will be an increase expenditure as compare to 1928 on veteran of $ 255,000,000 and an increase expenditure on construction work which may reach $ 520,000,000 despite large economy in other direction we have an indicate deficit include the statutory retirement of the debt of $ 2,123,000,000 and an indicate net debt increase of about $ 1,711,000,000
 the budget for the fiscal year begin july 1 next after allow for some increase of taxis under the present law and after allow for drastic reduction in expenditure still indicate a deficit of $ 1,417,000,000 after offset the statutory debt retirement this would indicate an increase in the national debt for the fiscal year 1933 of about $ 921,000,000
 several conclusion be inevitable we must have insistent and determined reduction in government expense we must face a temporary increase in taxis such increase should not cover the whole of these deficit or it will retard recovery we must partially finance the deficit by borrow it be my view that the amount of taxation should be fix so as to balance the budget for 1933 except for the statutory debt retirement such government receipt would assure the balance of the follow year&#39;s budget include debt retirement it be my further view that the additional taxation should be impose solely as an emergency measure terminate definitely two year from july 1 next such a basis will give confidence in the determination of the government to stabilize its finance and will assure taxpayer of its temporary character even with increase taxation the government will reach the utmost safe limit of its borrowing capacity by the expenditure for which we be already obligate and the recommendation here propose to go far than these limit in either expenditure taxis or borrowing will destroy confidence denude commerce and industry of its resource jeopardize the financial system and actually extend unemployment and demoralize agriculture rather than relieve it
 federal land bank
 i recommend that the congress authorize the subscription by the treasury of further capital to the federal land bank to be retire as provide in the original act or when fund be available and that repayment of such capital be treat as a fund available for further subscription in the same manner it be urgent that the bank be support so as to stabilize the market value of their bond and thus secure capital for the farmer at low rate that they may continue their service to agriculture and that they may meet the present situation with consideration to the farmer
 deposit in closed bank
 a method should be devise to make available quickly to depositor some portion of their deposit in close bank as the asset of such bank may warrant such provision would go far to relieve distress in a multitude of family would stabilize value in many community and would liberate work capital to thousand of concern i recommend that measure be enact promptly to accomplish these result and i suggest that the congress should consider the development of such a plan through the federal reserve banks
 home loan discount bank
 i recommend the establishment of a system of home loan discount bank as the necessary companion in our financial structure of the federal reserve banks and our federal land banks such action will relieve present distressing pressure against home and farm property owner it will relieve pressure upon and give add strength to building and loan association saving bank and deposit bank engage in extend such credit such action would far decentralize our credit structure it would revive residential construction and employment it would enable such loan institution more effectually to promote home ownership i discuss this plan at some length in a statement make public november 14 last this plan have be warmly indorse by the recent national conference upon home ownership and housing whose member be designate by the governor of the states and the group interested
 reconstruction finance corporation
 in order that the public may be absolutely assure and that the government may be in position to meet any public necessity i recommend that an emergency reconstruction corporation of the nature of the former war finance corporation should be establish it may not be necessary to use such an instrumentality very extensively the very existence of such a bulwark will strengthen confidence the treasury should be authorize to subscribe a reasonable capital to it and it should be give authority to issue its own debenture it should be place in liquidation at the end of two year its purpose be that by strengthen the weak spot to thus liberate the full strength of the nation&#39;s resource it should be in position to facilitate export by american agency make advance to agricultural credit agency where necessary to protect and aid the agricultural industry to make temporary advance upon proper security to established industry railway and financial institution which can not otherwise secure credit and where such advance will protect the credit structure and stimulate employment its function would not overlap those of the national credit corporation
 federal reserve eligibility
 on october 6th i issue a statement that i should recommend to the congress an extension during emergency of the eligibility provision in the federal reserve act this statement be approve by a representative gathering of the members of both houses of the congress include member of the appropriate committee it be approve by the official of the treasury department and i understand such an extension have be approve by a majority of the governor of the federal reserve bank nothing should be do which would lower the safeguard of the system
 the establishment of the mortgage discount bank herein refer to will also contribute to further reserve strength in the bank without inflation
 banking law
 our people have a right to a banking system in which their deposit shall be safeguard and the flow of credit less subject to storm the need of a sounder system be plainly show by the extent of bank failure i recommend the prompt improvement of the banking law change financial condition and commercial practice must be meet the congress should investigate the need for separation between different kind of banking an enlargement of branch banking under proper restriction and the method by which enlarge membership in the federal reserve system may be bring about
 postal savings bank
 the postal savings deposit have increase from about $ 200,000,000 to about $ 550,000,000 during the past year this experience have raise important practical question in relation to deposit and investment which should receive the attention of the congress
 railway
 the railway present one of our immediate and press problem they be and must remain the backbone of our transportation system their prosperity be interrelate with the prosperity of all industry their fundamental service in transportation the volume of their employment their buying power for supply from other industry the enormous investment in their security particularly their bond by insurance company saving bank benevolent and other trust all reflect their partnership in the whole economic fabric through these institution the railway bond be in a large sense the investment of every family the well maintain and successful operation and the stability of railway finance be of primary importance to economic recovery they should have more effective opportunity to reduce operating cost by proper consolidation as their rate must be regulate in public interest so also approximate regulation should be apply to compete service by some authority the method of their regulation should be revise the interstate commerce commission have make important and far reach recommendation upon the whole subject which i commend to the early consideration of the congress
 antitrust law
 in my message of a year ago i comment on the necessity of congressional inquiry into the economic action of the antitrust law there be wide conviction that some change should be make especially in the procedure under these law i do not favor their repeal such action would open wide the door to price fixing monopoly and destruction of healthy competition particular attention should be give to the industry round upon natural resource especially where destructive competition produce great waste of these resource and bring great hardship upon operator employee and the public in recent year there have be continue demoralization in the bituminous coal oil and lumber industry i again commend the matter to the consideration of the congress
 unemployment
 as an aid to unemployment the federal government be engage in the great program of public building harbor flood control highway waterway aviation merchant and naval ship construction in all history our expenditure on these work during this calendar year will reach about $ 780,000,000 compare with $ 260,000,000 in 1928 through this increase construction through the maintenance of a full complement of federal employee and through service to veteran it be estimate that the federal taxpayer be now directly contribute to the livelihood of 10,000,000 of our citizen
 we must avoid burden upon the government which will create more unemployment in private industry than can be gain by further expansion of employment by the federal government we can now stimulate employment and agriculture more effectually and speedily through the voluntary measure in progress through the thawing out of credit through the building up of stability abroad through the home loan discount bank through an emergency finance corporation and the rehabilitation of the railway and other such direction
 i be oppose to any direct or indirect government dole the breakdown and increased unemployment in europe be due in part to such practice our people be provide against distress from unemployment in true american fashion by a magnificent response to public appeal and by action of the local government
 general legislation
 there be many other subject require legislative action at this session of the congress i may list the following among they
 veterans&#39 services
 the law enact last march authorize loan of 50 per cent upon adjust service certificate have together with the loan make under previous law result in payment of about $ 1,260,000,000 appropriation have be exhaust the administrator of veterans&#39 affair advise that a further appropriation of $ 200,000,000 be require at once to meet the obligation make necessary by exist legislation
 there will be demand for further veterans&#39 legislation there be inequality in our system of veterans&#39 relief it be our national duty to meet our obligation to those who have serve the nation but our present expenditure upon these service now exceed $ 1,000,000,000 per annum i be oppose to any extension of these expenditure until the country have recover from the present situation

 muscle shoal
 at my suggestion the governors and legislatures of alabama and tennessee select three member each for service on a committee to which i appoint a representative of the farm organization and two representative of the war department for the purpose of recommend a plan for the disposal of these property which would be in the interest of the people of those states and the agricultural industry throughout the country i shall transmit the recommendation to the congress
 reorganization of federal department
 i have refer in previous message to the profound need of further reorganization and consolidation of federal administrative function to eliminate overlap and waste and to enable coordination and definition of government policy now wholly impossible in scattered and conflict agency which deal with part of the same major function i shall lay before the congress further recommendation upon this subject particularly in relation to the department of the interior there be two direction of such reorganization however which have an important bearing upon the emergency problem with which we be confront
 shipping board
 at present the shipping board exercise large administrative function independent of the executive these administrative function should be transfer to the department of commerce in keep with that single responsibility which have be the basis of our governmental structure since its foundation there should be create in that department a position of assistant secretary for merchant marine under whom this work and the several bureaus have to do with merchant marine may be group
 the shipping board should be make a regulatory body act also in advisory capacity on loan and policy in keep with its original conception its regulatory power should be amend to include regulation of coastwise shipping so as to assure stability and well service it be also worthy of consideration that the regulation of rate and service upon the inland waterway should be assign to such a reorganize board
 reorganization of public works administration
 i recommend that all building and construction activity of the government now carry on by many department be consolidate into an independent establishment under the president to be know as the public works administration direct by a public works administrator this agency should undertake all construction work in service to the different department of the government except naval and military work the service of the corps of army engineers should be delegate in rotation for military duty to this administration in continuation of their supervision of river and harbor work great economy sounder policy more effective coordination to employment and expedition in all construction work would result from this consolidation
 law enforcement
 i shall present some recommendation in a special message look to the strengthening of criminal law enforcement and improvement in judicial procedure connect therewith
 inland waterway and harbor improvement
 these improvement be now proceed upon an unprecedented scale some indication of the volume of work in progress be convey by the fact that during the current year over 380,000,000 cubic yard of material have be move an amount equal to the entire removal in the construction of the panama canal the mississippi waterway system connect chicago kansas city pittsburgh and new orleans will be in full operation during 1933 substantial progress be be make upon the project of the upper missouri upper mississippi etc
 negotiation be now in progress with canada for the construction of the st. lawrence waterway
 the tariff
 wages and standard of live abroad have be materially lower during the past year the temporary abandonment of the gold standard by certain country have also reduce their production cost compare to ours fortunately any increase in the tariff which may be necessary to protect agriculture and industry from these lower foreign cost or decrease in item which may prove to be excessive may be undertake at any time by the tariff commission under authority which it possess by virtue of the tariff act of 1930 the commission during the past year have review the rate upon over 254 item subject to tariff as a result of vigorous and industrious action it be up to date in the consideration of pende reference and be prepared to give prompt attention to any further application this procedure present an orderly method for correct inequality i be oppose to any general congressional revision of the tariff such action would disturb industry business and agriculture it would prolong the depression
 immigration and deportation
 i recommend that immigration restriction now in force under administrative action be place upon a more definite basis by law the deportation law should be strengthen alien lawfully in the country should be protect by the issuance of a certificate of residence
 public health
 i again call attention to my previous recommendation upon this subject particularly in its relation to child the moral result be of the utmost importance
 conclusion
 it be inevitable that in these time much of the legislation propose to the congress and many of the recommendation of the executive must be design to meet emergency in reach solution we must not jeopardize those principle which we have find to be the basis of the growth of the nation the federal government must not encroach upon nor permit local community to abandon that precious possession of local initiative and responsibility again just as the large measure of responsibility in the government of the nation rest upon local self government so do the large measure of social responsibility in our country rest upon the individual if the individual surrender his own initiative and responsibility he be surrender his own freedom and his own liberty it be the duty of the national government to insist that both the local government and the individual shall assume and bear these responsibility as a fundamental of preserve the very basis of our freedom
 many vital change and movement of vast proportion be take place in the economic world the effect of these change upon the future can not be see clearly as yet of this however we be sure our system base upon the ideal of individual initiative and of equality of opportunity be not an artificial thing rather it be the outgrowth of the experience of america and express the faith and spirit of our people it have carry we in a century and a half to leadership of the economic world if our economic system do not match our high expectation at all time it do not require revolutionary action to bring it into accord with any necessity that experience may prove it have successfully adjust itself to change condition in the past it will do so again the mobility of our institution the richness of our resource and the ability of our people enable we to meet they unafraid it be a distressful time for many of our people but they have show quality as high in fortitude courage and resourcefulness as ever in our history with that spirit i have faith that out of it will come a sounder life a true standard of value a great recognition of the result of honest effort and a healthy atmosphere in which to rear our child our must be a country of such stability and security as can not fail to carry forward and enlarge among all the people that abundant life of material and spiritual opportunity which it have represent among all nation since its beginning

the president say
 in my recommendation to congress and in the organization create during the past few month there be a definite program for turn the tide of deflation and start the country upon the road to recovery this program have be formulate after consultation with leader of every branch of american public life of labor of agriculture of commerce and of industry a considerable part of it depend on voluntary organization in the country this be already in action a part of it require legislation it be a nonpartisan program i be interested in its principle rather than its detail i appeal for unity of action for its consummation
 the major step that we must take be domestic the action need be in the home field and it be urgent while reestablishment of stability abroad be helpful to we and to the world and i be confident that it be in progress yet we must depend upon ourselves if we devote ourselves to these urgent domestic question we can make a very large measure of recovery irrespective of foreign influence
 that the country may get this program thoroughly in mind i review its major part
 1 provision for distress among the unemployed by voluntary organization and united action of local authority in cooperation with the president&#39;s unemployment relief organization whose appeal for organization and fund have meet with a response unparalleled since the war almost every locality in the country have report that it will take care of its own in order to assure that there will be no failure to meet problem as they arise the organization will continue through the winter
 2 our employer be organize and will continue to give part time work instead of discharge a portion of their employee this plan be afford help to several million people who otherwise would have no resource the government will continue to aid unemployment over the winter through the large program of federal construction now in progress this program represent an expenditure at the rate of over $ 60 million a month

 6 the enlargement under full safeguard of the discount facility of the federal reserve bank in the interest of a more adequate credit system
 7 the creation for the period of the emergency of a reconstruction finance corporation to furnish necessary credit otherwise unobtainable under exist circumstance and so give confidence to agriculture to industry and to labor against far paralyze influence and shock but more especially by the reopening of credit channel which will assure the maintenance and normal working of the commercial fabric
 8 assistance to all railroad by protection from unregulated competition and to the weak one by the formation of a credit pool as authorize by the interstate commerce commission and by other measure thus afford security to the bond hold by our insurance company our saving bank and other benevolent trust thereby protect the interest of every family and promote the recuperation of the railway

 c a temporary increase in taxation so distribute that the burden may be bear in proportion to ability to pay amongst all group and in such a fashion as not to retard recovery
 12 the maintenance of the american system of individual initiative and individual and community responsibility
 the broad purpose of this program be to restore the old job instead of create a make job to help the worker at the desk as well as the bench to restore their buying power for the farmers&#39 product in fact turn the process of liquidation and deflation and start the country forward all along the line
 this program will affect favorably every man woman and child not a special class or any group one of its purpose be to start the flow of credit now impede by fear and uncertainty to the detriment of every manufacturer business man and farmer to reestablish normal functioning be the need of the hour


 an emergency have develop in the last few day which it be my duty to lay before the senate
 the continue downward movement in the economic life of the country have be particularly accelerate during the past few day and it relate in part definitely to the financial program of the government there can be no doubt that superimpose upon other cause the long continue delay in the passage of legislation provide for such reduction in expense and such addition to revenue as would balance the budget together with proposal of project which would greatly increase governmental expenditure have give rise to doubt and anxiety as to the ability of our government to meet its responsibility these fear and doubt have be foolishly exaggerated in foreign country they know from bitter experience that the course of unbalanced budget be the road of ruin they do not realize that slow as our process may be we be determined and have the resource to place the finance of the united states on an unassailable basis
 the immediate result have be to create an entirely unjustified run upon the american dollar from foreign country and within the past few day despite our national wealth and resource and our unparalleled gold reserve our dollar stand at a serious discount in the market of the world for the first time in half a century this can be and must be immediately correct or the reaction upon our economic situation will be such as to cause great loss to our people and will still further retard recovery nor be the confusion in public mind and the rise feeling of doubt and fear confine to foreign country it reflect itself directly in diminished economic activity and increase unemployment within our own border and among our own citizen there be thus further stress upon already diminish and strained economic life of the country
 no one have a more sympathetic realization than i of the difficulty and complexity of the problem with which the congress be confront the decrease in revenue due to the depression by upwards of $ 1,700 million and the consequent necessity to reduce government expenditure the sacrifice such reduction call for from many group and section the further sacrifice call for in the distribution of the remain burden by the imposition of new taxis all constitute a problem which naturally arouse wide divergence of sectional interest and individual view yet if we be to secure a just distribution of these sacrifice in such fashion as to establish confidence in the integrity of the government we must secure an adjustment of these view to quick and prompt national action direct at one sole purpose that be to unfetter the rehabilitation of industry agriculture and unemployment the time have come when we must all make sacrifice of some part of our particular view and bring these danger and degeneration to halt by expeditious action
 in the stress of this emergency i have confer with member of both party of the senate as to method by which the strain and stress could be overcome and the gigantic resource and energy of our people release from the fetter in which they be hold i have feel in the stress of this emergency a grave responsibility rest upon i not only to present the situation to the senate but to make suggestion as to the basis of adjustment between these view which i hope will lead to early action and i be address myself to the senate on this occasion as the major question under consideration be now before this body
 we have three major duty in legislation in order to accomplish our fundamental purpose
 1 drastic reduction of expenditure
 2 passage of adequate revenue legislation the combination of which with reduction will unquestionably beyond all manner of doubt declare to the world the balancing of the federal budget and the stabilizing of the american dollar
 3 passage of adequate relief legislation to assure the country against distress and to aid in employment pende the next session of congress
 it be essential that when we ask our citizen to undertake the burden of increase taxation we must give to they evidence of reduction of every expenditure not absolutely vital to the immediate conduct of the government the executive budget of last december provide for a reduction of expenditure in the next fiscal year over the then estimate expenditure of the current year by about $ 370 million i have recommend to the congress from time to time the necessity for passage of legislation which would give authority for further important reduction in expenditure not possible for consideration by either the executive or the committee of congress without such legislation
 an earnest nonpartisan effort be make to secure these purpose in a national economy bill in the house but it largely fail that subject be under review by the bipartisan committee appoint from the member of the senate appropriations committee and i be inform it have tentatively agree upon a recommendation which would aggregate saving of $ 250 million together with a number of undetermined further possibility i be not inform as to detail of these recommendation although i learn that my own suggestion in many instance have not be accept but i do know that the committee have make honest and earnest effort to reach a just reduction in expenditure and i trust therefore that despite any of our individual view or the sacrifice of any group that we can unite in support and expeditious adoption of the committee&#39;s conclusion in addition to the economy which may be bring about through the economy bill the direct reduction of the appropriation committee should increase this figure to at least $ 400 million not include certain postponement to later deficiency bill as this sum form the basis of calculation as to increase taxis necessary it be essential that no matter what the detail may be that amount of reduction must be obtain or taxis must be increase to compensate if this minimum of $ 400 million be attain by congressional action together with the $ 369 million effect through executive budget except for amount already budget for public work in aid to unemployment and increase cost of veteran we will have reduce expenditure of this government to the low point since 1916
 in the matter of tax legislation we must face the plain and unpalatable fact that due to the degeneration in the economic situation during the past month the estimate of fertility of taxis which have be make from time to time base upon the then current prospect of business must be readjust to take account of the decrease business activity and shrink value the finance committee have be advise that the setback of the past month now make it evident that if we be to have absolute assurance of the need income with breadth of base which would make a certainty of the collection we must face additional taxis to those now propose by the senate finance committee
 i recognize the complaint that estimate of the taxis require and reduction of expense need have be repeatedly increase but on the other hand it should be bear in mind that if tax and economy legislation recommend from time to time since last december have be promptly enact there would have be less degeneration and stagnation in the country but it be unprofitable to argue any such question we must face the situation as it exist today
 in the course of the 6 month during which the revenue bill have be consider in the house and senate practically every form of tax have be suggest at one time or another many have find their way into the bill later to be reject the total amount congress originally set out to obtain have be gradually whittle down either by actual reduction or degeneration of the situation while need have increase
 if we examine the major source of possible increase in taxis now propose and the nature of taxis already vote it may well be that the income taxis have already be raise to the point of diminish return through avoidance which will ensue by the use of tax exempt security and be already so high as to approach the danger point in retardation of enterprise it be advisable that more relief should be give to earn income nor will far increase in income tax even include the proposal of senator connally 1 cover the gap in our revenue or provide against any failure to reduce expense to the full amount i have state the senate have already impose a multitude of specific manufacturer excise taxis on special industry some of they appear discriminatory and uncertain in their productivity i have not and do not favor a general sale tax it have not be propose by the treasury a sale tax be not however to be confuse with an extension of the special manufacturer excise taxis to a general manufacturer excise tax with exemption of food and clothing this be an entirely different tax from a so call sale tax and can not be pyramid even this general manufacturer excise tax have not be propose by the treasury although at the time such a tax be unanimously recommend by the ways and means committee of the house represent both political party and their leader in the house of representatives the secretary of the treasury accept it in the hope that immediate passage of the bill would result in order however to solve our problem and give assurance to the country and the world of the impregnability of the american dollar and that we be ready to meet our emergency at any sacrifice i have now come to favor an extension for a limited period of the many special excise taxis to a more general manufacturer excise tax and will support the congress if it should be adopt whether this be the course or not some further emergency tax source should be incorporate in the pende bill
 1 on may 16 1932 senator tom connally o&#1114 texas offer an amendment to the revenue bill provide for income taxis range up to 55 percent in the high bracket the senate reject the amendment on may 17
 our third problem be that of relief the sharp degeneration have its many reflex in distress and hardship upon our people i hold that the maintenance of the sense of individual and personal responsibility of man to their neighbor and the proper separation of function of the federal and local government require the maintenance of the fundamental principle that the obligation of distress rest upon the individual upon the community and upon the states in order however that there may be no failure on the part of any state to meet its obligation in this direction i have after consultation with some of the party leader on both side favor authorization to the reconstruction finance corporation to loan up to $ 300 million to state government where they be unable to finance themselves in provision of relief to distress such loan should be make by purchase of state bond by the corporation but where states be unable to issue bond then loan should be make upon application of state authority and if they be not regularize by the issuance of bond within a period of 12 to 18 month they should become a charge upon the federal aid fund to which such states may be entitle
 in order to aid unemployment and to avoid wasteful expansion of public work i have favor an authority to the reconstruction corporation to increase its issue of its security to the maximum of $ 3 billion in order that it may extend its service both in aid to employment and agriculture on a wide scale under the method propose the corporation be to be a authorize to buy bond from political subdivision or public body to aid in construction of income produce or self liquidate project b to make loan to establish enterprise upon adequate security for advancement of sound project that will increase employment but safeguard by requirement that some portion of outside capital be also provide c to divert a portion of the unexpended authorization of agricultural loan through the secretary of agriculture to finance export of agricultural product d to make loan to institution upon security of agricultural commodity to assure the carrying of normal stock of these commodity and thus by stabilize their loan value to steady their price level e to make loan to the federal farm board to enable extension of finance of farm cooperative
 i have not be able to favor the expansion of public work beyond the program already propose in the budget i have for many year advocate speed up of public work as relief to unemployment in time of depression since the beginning of this depression in consonance with this view the federal government will have expend in excess of $ 1,500 million in construction and maintenance of one kind or another as against a normal program of perhaps $ 650 million for a similar period the budget for next year call for over $ 550 million or double our usual outlay if we shall now increase these program we shall need instantly to increase taxis still far we have already force every project which we have justification with any regard to the taxpayer and the avoidance of sheer waste it be not my desire on this occasion to argue the comparative merit of extend such a program and that of finance an even large program of employment on productive work through the reconstruction finance corporation we be indeed all desirous of serve our fellow citizen who be in difficulty and we must serve they in such a fashion that we do not increase the rank of unemployed i may emphasize that this alternative program avoid drain upon the taxpayer and above all if we be to balance our budget and balance it in such fashion that our people and the world may know it be balance we can not make further appropriation in any direction beyond the amount now before the congress
 i be confident that if the congress could find in these suggestion which come from member of both party a ground for adjustment of legislation on those dominant particular and could bring it into immediate action it would yield not only relief to the country but would reestablish that confidence which we so sorely need
 the natural wealth of this country be unimpaire and the inherent ability of our people to meet their problem be be restrain by failure of the government to act time be of the essence every day&#39;s delay make new wound and extend they i come before you in sympathy with the difficulty which the problem present and in a sincere spirit of helpfulness i ask of you to accept such a basis of practical adjustment essential to the welfare of our people in your hand at this moment be the answer to the question whether democracy have the capacity to act speedily enough to save itself in emergency the nation urgently need unity it need solidarity before the world in demonstrate that america have the courage to look its difficulty in the face and the capacity and resolution to meet they

mr. chairman and my fellow citizen
 in accept the great honor that you have bring to i i desire to speak so simply and so plainly that every man and woman in the united states who may hear or read my word can not misunderstand
 the last 3 year have be a time of unparalleled economic calamity they have be year of great suffering and hardship than any which have come to the american people since the aftermath of the civil war as we look back over these troubled year we realize that we have pass through two different stage of dislocation and distress
 before the storm break we be steadily gain in prosperity our wound from the war be rapidly heal advance in science and invention have open vast vista of new progress be prosperous we become optimistic all of we from optimism some of we go to overexpansion in anticipation of the future and from overexpansion to reckless speculation in the soil poison by speculation grow those ugly weed of waste exploitation and abuse of financial power in this overproduction and speculative mania we march with the rest of the whole world then 3 year ago come retribution by the inevitable worldwide slump in the consumption of good in price and employment at that juncture it be the normal penalty for a reckless boom such as we have witness a score of time in our national history through such depression we have always pass safely after a relatively short period of loss of hardship and of adjustment we have adopt policy in the government which be fitting to the situation gradually the country begin to right itself eighteen month ago there be a solid basis for hope that recovery be in sight
 then there come to we a new calamity a blow from abroad of such dangerous character as to strike at the very safety of the republic the country of europe prove unable to withstand the stress of the depression the memory of the world have ignore the fact that the insidious disease leave by the great war have not be cure the skill and intelligence of million in europe have be blot out by battle by disease and by starvation stupendous burden of national debt have be build up poisoned spring of political instability lie in the treaty which close the war fear and hate hold armament to double those before the great conflict government be fallaciously seek to build back by enlarged borrowing by subsidize industry and employment from taxis that slowly sap the saving upon which industry and rejuvenate commerce must be build under these strain the financial system of foreign country crash one by one
 new blow with decrease world consumption of good and from fail financial system rain upon our people we be a part of the world the disturbance of whose remotest population affect our financial system our employment our market and the price of our farm product thus begin 18 month ago the worldwide storm grow rapidly to hurricane force and the great economic emergency in all the history of the world unexpected unforeseen violent shock with every month bring new danger and new emergency to our country fear and apprehension grip the heart of our people in every village and city
 if we look back over the disaster of these 3 year we find that three quarter of the population of the globe have suffer from the flame of revolution many nation have be subject to constant change and vacillation of government other have resort to dictatorship or tyranny in desperate attempt to preserve some kind of social order
 i may pause for one short illustration of the character of one single destructive force arise from these cause which we have be compel to meet that be its effect upon our financial structure foreign country in the face of their own failure the failure of their neighbor not believe that we have either the courage or the ability or the strength to meet this crisis withdraw from the united states over $ 2,400 million include a billion of gold our own alarmed citizen withdraw over $ 1,600 million of currency from our bank into hoarding these action combine with the fear that they generate cause a shrinkage of credit available for the conduct of industry and commerce by several time even these vast sum its visible expression be the failure of bank and business the demoralization of security and real property value of the commodity price and of employment and that be but one of the invade force of destruction that we have be compel to meet in the last 18 month
 two course be open to we we might have do nothing that would have be utter ruin instead we meet the situation with proposal to private business and to the congress of the most gigantic program of economic defense and counterattack ever evolve in the history of the republic we put that program in action
 our measure have repel these attack of fear and panic we have maintain the financial integrity of the government we have cooperate to restore and stabilize the situation abroad as a nation we have pay every dollar demand of we we have use the credit of the government to aid and protect our institution both public and private we have provide method and assurance that none suffer from hunger or cold amongst our people we have institute measure to assist our farmer and our homeowner we have create vast agency for employment above all we have maintain the sanctity of the principle upon which this republic have grow great
 in a large sense the test of the success of our program be simple our people while suffer great hardship have be and will be care for in the long view our institution have be sustain intact and be now function with increase confidence for the future as a nation we be undefeated and unafraid and again above all government by the people have not be defile
 with the humility of one who by necessity have stand in the midst of this storm i can say with pride that the distinction for these accomplishment belong not to the government or to any individual it be due to the intrepid soul of our people it be to their character their fortitude their initiative and their courage that we owe these result we of this generation do not build this great ship of state but the policy that we have inaugurate have protect and aid its navigation in this terrible storm these policy and program have not be partisan i gladly give tribute to those member of the democratic party in the congress whose patriotic cooperation against factional and demagogic opposition have assist in a score of great undertaking i likewise give credit to democratic as well as republican leader among our citizen for their cooperation and their help
 a record of these danger and these policy of the last 3 year will be set down in the book much of it be of interest only to history our interest now be in the future i dwell upon these policy and these program and problem only where they illustrate the question of the day and our course for the future as a government and as a people we still have much to do we must continue the building of our measure of restoration we must profit by the lesson of this experience
 before i enter upon a discussion of these policy i wish to say something of my conception of the relation of our government to the people and the responsibility of both particularly as apply to these time the spirit and the devising of this government by the people be to sustain a dual purpose on the one hand to protect our people amongst nation and in domestic emergency by great national power and on the other to preserve individual liberty and freedom through local self government
 the function of the federal government in these time be to use its reserve power and its strength for the protection of citizen and local government by the support to our institution against force beyond their control it be not the function of the government to relieve individual of their responsibility to their neighbor or to relieve private institution of their responsibility to the public or the local government to the states or the responsibility of state government to the federal government in give that protection and that aid the federal government must insist that all of they exert their responsibility in full it be vital that the program of the government shall not compete with or replace any of they but shall add to their initiative and to their strength it be vital that by the use of public revenue and public credit in emergency that the nation shall be strengthen and not weaken
 and in all these emergency and crisis and in all our future policy we must also preserve the fundamental principle of our social and our economic system that system be round upon a conception of order freedom the test of that freedom be that there should be maintain an equality of opportunity to every individual so that he may achieve for himself the good to which his character ability and ambition entitle he it be only by the release of initiative this insistence upon individual responsibility that we accrue the great sum of individual accomplishment which carry this nation forward this be not an individualism which permit man to run riot in selfishness or to override equality of opportunity for other it permit no violation of order liberty in the race after false god of materialism man and group have forget their country equality of opportunity contain no conception of exploitation by any selfish ruthless class minded man or group they have no place in the american system as against these stand the guide ideal and the concept of our nation i propose to maintain they
 the solution of our many problem which arise from the shift scene of national life be not to be find in haphazard experimentation or by revolution it must be through organic development of our national life under these ideal it must secure that cooperative action which bring initiative and strength outside of the government it do not follow because our difficulty be stupendous because there be some soul timorous enough to doubt the validity and effectiveness of our ideal and our system that we must turn to a state control or state direct social or economic system in order to cure our trouble that be not liberalism that be tyranny it be the regimentation of man under autocratic bureaucracy with all its extinction of liberty of hope and of opportunity of course no man of understanding say that our system work perfectly it do not for the human race be not yet perfect nevertheless the movement of true civilization be towards freedom rather than regimentation and that be our ideal
 ofttime the tendency of democracy in the presence of national danger be to strike blindly to listen to demagogue and to slogan all of which destroy and do not save we have refuse to be stampede into such course ofttime democracy elsewhere in the world have be unable to move fast enough to save itself in emergency there have be dishearten delay and failure in legislation and private action which -have add to the loss of our people yet this democracy of our have prove its ability to act
 our emergency measure of the last 3 year form a definite strategy dominate in the background by these american principle and ideal form a continuous campaign wage against the force of destruction on an ever widening and a constantly shift front
 thus we have hold that the federal government should in the presence of great national danger use its power to give leadership to the initiative the courage and the fortitude of the people themselves but that it must insist upon individual community and state responsibility that it should furnish leadership to assure the coordination and unity of great exist agency governmental and private for economic and humanitarian action that where it become necessary to meet emergency beyond the power of these agency by the creation of new governmental instrumentality that they should be of such character as not to supplant or weaken but rather to supplement and strengthen the initiative and enterprise of our people that they must directly or indirectly serve all of the people and above all that they should be set up in such form that once the emergency be past they can and must be demobilize and withdraw leave our governmental economic and social structure strong and whole
 we have not fear boldly to adopt unprecedented measure to meet unprecedented violence of the storm but because we have keep ever before we these eternal principle of our nation the american government in its ideal be the same as it be when the people give the presidency to my trust we shall keep it so we have resolutely reject the temptation under pressure of immediate event to resort to those panacea and short cut which even if temporarily successful would ultimately undermine and weaken what have slowly be build and mold by experience and effort throughout these 150 year
 it be in accordance with these principle that at the first stage of the depression i call upon the leader of business and of labor and of agriculture to meet with i and induce they by their own initiative to organize against the panic with all its devastating destruction to uphold wage until the cost of living be adjust to spread exist employment through shorten hour and to advance construction work against future need
 it be in pursuance of that same policy that i have each winter thereafter assume the leadership in mobilize all of the voluntary and official organization throughout the country to prevent suffering from hunger and cold and to protect million of family stricken by drought and when it become advisable to strengthen the states who could no long carry the full burden of relief to distress it be in accordance with these principle that we hold that the federal government should do so through loan to the states and thus maintain the fundamental responsibility of the states themselves we stop the attempt to turn this effort to the politic of selfish sectional demand and we keep it base upon human need
 it be in accordance with these principle that in aid to unemployment we expend some $ 600 million in federal construction of such public work as can be justify as bring early and definite return we have oppose the distortion of these need work into pork barrel nonproductive work which impoverish the nation
 it be in accord with these principle and these purpose that we have make provision for $ 1,500 million of loan to self support work so that we may increase employment in productive labor we reject project of wasteful nonproductive work allocate for purpose of attract vote instead of afford relief thereby instead of wasteful drain upon the taxpayer we secure the return of their cost to government agency and at the same time we increase the wealth of the nation
 it be in accordance with these principle that we have strengthen the capital of the federal land bank that on the one hand confidence in their security should not be impaired and that on the other the farmer indebted to they should not be unduly deprive of their home it be in accordance with these purpose that the farm board by emergency loan to farmers&#39 cooperative serve to stem panic in agricultural price and save hundred of thousand of farmer and their creditor from bankruptcy it be in accord with these idea that we have create agency to prevent bankruptcy and failure in their cooperative organization that we be erect new instrumentality to give credit facility for their livestock grower and their orderly marketing of their farm product
 it be in accordance with these principle that in the face of the loom european crisis we seek to change the trend of european economic degeneration by our proposal of the german moratorium and the standstill agreement on german private debt we stem the tide of collapse in germany and the consequent ruin of its people in furtherance of world stability we have make proposal to reduce the cost of world armament by $ 1 billion a year
 it be in accordance with these principle that i first secure the creation by private initiative of the national credit association whose effort prevent the failure of hundred of bank and the loss to countless thousand of depositor who have loan all of their saving to they
 it be in accord with these idea that as the storm grow in intensity we create the reconstruction finance corporation with a capital of 2 billion more to uphold the credit structure of the nation and by thus raise the shield of government credit we prevent the wholesale failure of bank of insurance company of building and loan association of farm mortgage association and of railroad in all of which the public interest be paramount this disaster have be avert through the saving of more than 5,000 institution and the knowledge that adequate assistance be available to tide other over the stress this have be do not to save a few stockholder but to save 25 million of american family every one of whose very saving and employment might have be wipe out and whose whole future would have be blight have these institution go down
 it be in accordance with these principle that we expand the function and the power of the federal reserve bank that they might counteract the stupendous shrinkage of credit due to fear and to hoarding and the foreign withdrawal of our resource
 it be in accordance with these principle that we be now in process of establish a new system of home loan bank so that through add strength and through cooperation between the building and loan association the saving bank and other institute we may relax the pressure on forfeiture of home and procure the release of new resource for the construction of more home and the employment of more man
 it be in accordance with these principle that we have insist upon a reduction of governmental expense for no country can squander itself to prosperity on the ruin of its taxpayer and it be in accordance with these purpose that we have seek new revenue to equalize the diminish income of the government in order that the power of the federal government to meet the emergency should be impregnable
 it be in accordance with these principle that we have join in the development of a world economic conference to bulwark the whole international fabric of finance of monetary value and the expansion of world commerce
 it be in accordance with these principle and these policy that i be today organize the private industrial and financial resource of the country to cooperate effectively with the vast governmental instrumentality which we have in motion so that through their united and coordinated effort we may move from defense to a powerful attack upon the depression along the whole national front
 these program unparallele in the history of depression of any country and in any time to care for distress to provide employment to aid agriculture to maintain the financial stability of the country to safeguard the saving of the people to protect their home be not in the past tense they be in action i shall propose such other measure public and private as may be necessary from time to time to meet the change situation that may occur and to far speed our economic recovery that recovery may be slow but we shall succeed
 and come what may i shall maintain through all these measure the sanctity of the great principle under which the republic over a period of 150 year have grow to be the great nation of the earth
 i should like to digress a second for an observation on the last 3 year which should exhilarate the faith of every american and that be the profound growth of the sense of social responsibility in our nation which this depression have demonstrate
 no government in washington have hitherto consider that it hold so broad a responsibility for leadership in such time despite hardship the devotion of our man and woman to those in distress be demonstrate by the national average of infant mortality general mortality and sickness which be less today than in time even of prosperity for the first time in the history of depression dividend and profit and the cost of living have be reduce before wage have be sacrifice we have be more free from industrial conflict through strike and lockout and all form of social disorder than even in normal time the nation be build the initiative of man and of woman toward new field of social cooperation and new field of endeavor
 so much for the great national emergency and the principle of government for which we stand and their application to the measure we have take
 there be national policy wide than the emergency wide than the economic horizon they be set forth in our platform having have the responsibility of this office my view upon most of they be clearly and often set forth in public record i may however summarize some of they
 first i be squarely for a protective tariff i be against the proposal of a competitive tariff for revenue as advocate by our opponent that would place our farmer and our worker in competition with peasant and sweat labor product from abroad
 second i be against their proposal to destroy the usefulness of the bipartisan tariff commission the establishment of whose effective power we secure during this administration just 25 year after it be first advocate by president theodore roosevelt that instrumentality enable we to correct any injustice and to readjust the rate of duty to shift economic change without constant tinkering and orgy of logroll by congress if our opponent will descend from the vague generalization to any particular schedule if it be high than necessary to protect our people or insufficient for their protection it can be remedie by this bipartisan commission without a national election
 third my view in opposition to the cancellation of the war debt be a matter of detailed record in many public statement and in a recent message to the congress they mark a continuity of that policy maintain by my predecessor i be hopeful of such drastic reduction of world armament as will save the taxpayer in debtor country a large part of the cost of their payment to we if for any particular annual payment we be offer some other tangible form of compensation such as the expansion of market for american agriculture and labor and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity then i be sure our citizen would consider such a proposal but it be a certainty that these debt must not be cancel or these burden transfer to the back of the american people
 fourth i insist upon an army and navy of a strength which guarantee that no foreign soldier will land upon the american soil that strength be relative to other nation i favor every arm reduction which preserve that relationship
 i favor rigidly restrict immigration i have by executive direction in order to relieve we of add unemployment already reduce the inward movement to less than the outward movement i shall adhere to that policy
 sixth i have repeatedly recommend to the congress a revision of railway transportation law in order that we may create great stability and great assurance of that vital service in our transportation i shall persist in it
 i have repeatedly recommend the federal regulation of interstate power i shall persist in that i have oppose the federal government undertake the operation of the power business i shall continue in that opposition
 i have for year support the conservation of national resource i have make frequent recommendation to the congress in respect thereto include legislation to correct the waste and destruction of these resource through the present interpretation of the antitrust law i shall continue to urge such action
 this depression have expose many weakness in our economic system there have be exploitation and abuse of financial power we will fearlessly and unremittingly reform these abuse i have recommend to the congress the reform of our banking law unfortunately this legislation have not yet be enact the american people must have protection from insecure banking through a strong banking system they must be relieve from condition which permit the credit machinery of the country to be make available without check for wholesale speculation in security with ruinous consequence to million of our citizen and to our national economy i have recommend to congress method of emergency relief to the depositor of close bank for 7 year i have repeatedly warn against private loan abroad for nonproductive purpose i shall persist in all those matter
 i have insist upon a balanced budget as the foundation of all public and private financial stability and of all public confidence i shall insist on the maintenance of that policy recent increase in revenue while temporary should be again examine and if they tend to sap the vitality of industry and thus retard employment they should be revise
 the first necessity of the nation the wealth and income of whose citizen have be reduce be to reduce the expenditure on government national state and local it be in the relief of taxis from the back of man through which we liberate their power it be through low expenditure that we get low taxis this must be do a considerable reduction in federal expenditure have be attain if we except those extraordinary expenditure impose upon we by the depression it will be find that the federal government be operate some $ 200 million less annually today than 4 year ago the congress reject recommendation from the administration which would have save an additional $ 150 million this fiscal year the opposition leadership insist as the price of vital reconstruction legislation and over the protest of our leader upon add $ 300 million of cost to the taxpayer through public work inadvisable at this time i shall repeat these proposal for economy the opposition leadership in the house of representatives in the last 4 month secure the passage by that house of $ 3 billion in raid upon the public treasury they have be stop and i shall continue to oppose such raid
 i have repeatedly for 7 year urge the congress either themselves to abolish obsolete bureaus and commission and to reorganize the whole government structure in the interest of economy or to give someone the authority to do it i have succeed partially in secure that authority but i regret that no great act under it can be effective until after the approval of the next congress
 with the collapse of world price and the depreciate currency the farmer be never so dependent upon his tariff protection for recovery as he be at the present time we shall hold to that as a national policy we have enact many measure of emergency relief to agriculture they be have their effect i shall keep they function until the strain be past the original purpose of the farm board be to strengthen the effort of the farmer to establish his own farmer own farmer control marketing agency it have greatly succeed in this purpose even in these time of adversity the departure of the farm board from its original purpose by make loan to farmers&#39 cooperative to preserve price from panic serve an emergency but such an action in normal time be absolutely destructive of the farmers&#39 own interest
 we still have vast problem to solve in agriculture but no power on earth can restore price except by restoration of the general recovery and by restoration of market every measure that we have take look to general recovery be of benefit to the farmer there be no relief to the farmer by extend governmental bureaucracy to control his production and thus to curtail his liberty nor by subsidy that bring only more bureaucracy and their ultimate collapse and i shall continue to oppose
 they
 the most practicable relief to the farmer today aside from general economic recovery be a definite program of readjustment and coordination of national state and local taxation which will relieve real property especially the farm from the unfair burden of taxation which the current readjustment in value have bring about to that purpose i propose to devote myself
 i have always favor the development of river and harbor and highway these improvement have be greatly expedite in the last 30 year we shall continue that work to completion after 20 year of discussion between the united states and our great neighbor to the north i have sign a treaty for the construction of the great lakes st. lawrence seaway that treaty do not injure the chicago to the gulf waterway the work upon which together with the whole mississippi system i have expedite and in which i be equally interested we shall undertake this great seaway the great public improvement ever undertake upon our continent with its consequent employment of man as quickly as that treaty can be ratify
 our view upon sound currency require no elucidation they be indelibly a part of republican history and policy we have affirm they by prevent the democratic majority in the house from effecting wild scheme of uncontrolled inflation in the last 4 month
 there be many other important subject set forth in the platform and in my public statement in the past for which i will not take your time there be one or two other that do merit some emphasis
 the leadership of the federal government be not to be confine to economic and international question there be problem of the home and the education of child and of citizenship they be the most vital of all to the future of the nation except in the case of aid to states which i have recommend for stimulation of the protection and health of child they be not matter of legislation we have give leadership to the initiative of our people for social advancement through this organization against illiteracy through the white house conference on the protection and health of child through the national conference on homeownership through the stimulation of social and recreational agency these be the visible evidence of spiritual leadership in the government they will be continue and they will be constantly invigorate
 my foreign policy have be devote to strengthen the foundation of world peace we inaugurate the london naval treaty which reduce arm and limit the ratio between the fleet of the three power we have make concrete proposal at geneva to reduce the armament of the world by one third it would save the taxpayer of the world a billion a year we could save ourselves 200 million a year it would reduce fear and danger of war we have expand the arbitration of dispute i have recommend join the world court under proper reservation preserve our freedom of action above all we have give leadership in the transforming of the kellogg briand pact from an inspire outlawry of war to an organize instrument for peaceful settlement back by definite mobilize world public opinion against aggression we shall under the spirit of that pact consult with other nation in time of emergency to promote world peace we shall enter into no agreement commit we to any future course of action or which call for use of force in order to preserve peace
 i have project a new doctrine into international affair the doctrine that we do not and never will recognize title to the possession of territory gain in violation of the peace pact which be sign with we that doctrine have be accept by all the nation of the world on a recent critical occasion and within the last few day have be again accept by all the nation of the western hemisphere that be public opinion make tangible and effective
 the world need peace it must have peace with justice i shall continue to strive unceasingly with every power of mind and spirit to explore every possible path that lead towards a world in which right triumph over force in which reason rule over passion in which man and woman may rear their child not to be devour by war but to pursue in safety the nobler art of peace
 i shall continue to build upon these design
 across the path of the nation&#39;s consideration of these vast problem of economic and social order there have arise a bitter controversy over the control of the liquor traffic i have always sympathize with the high purpose of the 18th amendment and i have use every power at my command to make it effective over this entire country i have hope that it be the final solution of the evil of the liquor traffic against which our people have strive for generation it have succeed in great measure in those many community where the majority sentiment be favorable to it but in other and increase number of community there be a majority sentiment unfavorable to it law which be oppose by the majority sentiment create resentment which undermine enforcement and in the end produce degeneration and crime
 our opponent pledge the member of their party to destroy every vestige of constitutional and effective federal control of the traffic that mean that over large area the return of the saloon system with its corruption its moral and social abuse which debauch the home its deliberate interference with the states endeavor to find honest solution its permeation of political party its perversion of legislature which reach even to the capital of the nation the 18th amendment smash that regime as by a stroke of lightning i can not consent to the return of that system again
 we must recognize the difficulty which have develop in make the 18th amendment effective and that grave abuse have grow up in order to secure the enforcement of the amendment under our dual form of government the constitutional provision call for concurrent action on one hand by the state and local authority and on the other by the federal government its enforcement require therefore independent but coincident action of both agency an increase number of states and municipality be prove themselves unwilling to engage in that enforcement due to these force there be in large section increase illegal traffic in liquor but bad than this there have be in those area a spread of disrespect not only for this law but for all law grave danger of practical nullification of the constitution an increase in subsidized crime and violence i can not consent to a continuation of that regime
 i refuse to accept either of these destiny on the one hand to return to the old saloon with its political and social corruption or on the other to endure the bootlegger and the speakeasy with their abuse and crime either of they be intolerable and they be not the only way out
 now our objective must be a sane solution not a blind leap back to old evil moreover a step backwards would result in a chaos of new evil not yet experienced because the local system of prohibition and control which be develop over generation have be in a large degree abandon under this amendment
 the republican platform recommend submission of the question to the states and that the people themselves may determine whether they desire a change but insist that this submission shall propose a constructive and not a destructive change it do not dictate to the conscience of any member of the party
 the first duty of the president of the united states be to enforce the law as they exist that i shall continue to do to the good of my ability any other course would be the abrogation of the very guarantee of liberty itself
 now the constitution give the president no power or authority with respect to change in the constitution itself nevertheless my countryman have a right to know my conclusion upon this question they be base upon the broad fact that i have state upon my experience in this high office and upon my deep conviction that our purpose must be the elimination of the evil of this traffic from this civilization by practical measure
 it be my belief that in order to remedy present evil a change be necessary by which we resummon a proper share of initiative and responsibility which the very essence of our government demand shall rest upon the states and the local authority that change must avoid the return of the saloon
 it be my conviction that the nature of this change and one upon which all reasonable people can find common ground be that each state shall be give the right to deal with the problem as it may determine but subject to the absolute guarantee in the constitution of the united states to protect each state from interference and invasion by its neighbor and that in no part of the united states shall there be a return of the saloon system with its inevitable political and social corruption and its organized interference with other states and other community
 american statesmanship be capable of work out such a solution and make it effective
 my fellow citizen the discussion of great problem of economic life and of government seem abstract and cold but within their right solution lie the happiness and the hope of a great people without such solution all else be mere verbal sympathy
 today million of our fellow countryman be out of work price of farmers&#39 product be below a live standard many million more who be in business or hold employment be haunt by fear for the future no man with a spark of humanity can sit in my place without suffer from the picture of their anxiety and hardship before he day and night they would be more than human if they be not lead to blame their condition upon the government in power i have understand their suffering and have work to the limit of my strength to produce action that would be of help to they
 much remain to be do to attain recovery we have have a great and unparalleled shock the emergency measure now in action represent an unparalleled use of national power to relieve distress to provide employment to serve agriculture to preserve the stability of the government and to maintain the integrity of our institution our policy prevent unemployment cause by flood of import good and of laborer our policy preserve peace in the world they embrace cooperation with other nation in those field in which we can serve with patience and perseverance these measure will succeed
 despite the dislocation of economic life our great tool of production and distribution be more efficient than ever before our fabulous national resource our farm and home and our skill be unimpaired from the hard won experience of this depression we shall build strong method of prevention and strong method of protection to our people from abuse that have become evident we shall march to a far great accomplishment
 with the united effort we can and will turn the tide towards the restoration of business of employment and of agriculture it do call for the utmost devotion and the utmost wisdom every reserve of american courage and vision must be call upon to sustain we and to plan wisely for the future
 through it all our first duty be to preserve unfettered that dominant american spirit which have produce our enterprise and our individual character that be the bedrock of the past and it be the sole guarantee of the future not regiment mechanism but free man be our goal herein be the fundamental issue a representative democracy progressive and unafraid to meet its problem but meet they upon the foundation of experience and not upon the wave of emotion or the insensate demand of a radicalism which grasp at every opportunity to exploit the suffering of a people
 with these course we shall emerge from this great national strain with our american system of life and government strengthen our people will be free to reassert their energy and their enterprise in a society eager to reward in full measure those whose industry serve its well being our youth will find the door of equal opportunity still open
 the problem of the next few year be not only economic they be also moral and spiritual the present check to our material success must deeply stir our national conscience upon the purpose of life itself it must cause we to revalue and reshape our drift from materialism to a high note of individual and national ideal
 underlie every purpose be the spiritual application of moral ideal which be the fundamental basis of the happiness of a people this be a land of home and of church and schoolhouse dedicated to the sober and endure satisfaction of family life and the rearing of child in an atmosphere of ideal and of religious faith only with those ideal and those high standard can we hold society together and only from they can government survive and business prosper they be the sole insurance to the safety of our child and to the continuity of the nation
 if it shall appear that while i have have the honor of the presidency that i have contribute to the part require from this high office to bring the republic through this dark night and if in my administration we shall see the break of dawn of the well day i shall have do my part in the world no man can have a great honor than that
 i have but one desire that be to see my country again on the road to prosperity which shall be more sane and last through the lesson of this experience to see the principle and ideal of the american people perpetuate
 i rest the case of the republican party upon the intelligence and the just discernment of the american people should my countryman again place upon i the responsibility of this high office i shall carry forward the work of reconstruction i shall hope long before another 4 year have pass to see the world prosperous and at peace and every american home again in the sunshine of genuine progress and of genuine prosperity i shall seek to maintain untarnished and unweakened those fundamental tradition and principle upon which our nation be rounded upon which it have grow i shall invite and welcome the help of every man and woman in the preservation of the united states for the happiness of its people this be my pledge to the nation and my pledge to the almighty god

this campaign be more than a contest between two man   it be more than a contest between two party   it be a contest between two philosophy of government
 we be tell by the opposition that we must have a change that we must have a new deal   it be not the change that come from normal development of national life to which i object but the proposal to alter the whole foundation of our national life which have be build through generation of testing and struggle and of the principle upon which we have build the nation   the expression our opponent use must refer to important change in our economic and social system and our system of government otherwise they be nothing but vacuous word   and i realize that in this time of distress many of our people be ask whether our social and economic system be incapable of that great primary function of provide security and comfort of life to all of the fireside of our 25,000,000 home in america whether our social system provide for the fundamental development and progress of our people whether our form of government be capable of originate and sustain that security and progress
 this question be the basis upon which our opponent be appeal to the people in their fear and distress   they be propose change and so call new deal which would destroy the very foundation of our american system
 our people should consider the primary fact before they come to the judgment&mdash;not merely through political agitation the glitter of promise and the discouragement of temporary hardships&mdash;whether they will support change which radically affect the whole system which have be build up by a hundred and fifty year of the toil of the father   they should not approach the question in the despair with which our opponent would clothe it
 our economic system have receive abnormal shock during the last three year which temporarily dislocate its normal functioning   these shock have in large sense come from without our border but i say to you that our system of government have enable we to take such strong action as to prevent the disaster which would otherwise have come to our nation   it have enable we far to develop measure and program which be now demonstrate their ability to bring about restoration and progress
 we must go deep than platitude and emotional appeal of the public platform in the campaign if we will penetrate to the full significance of the change which our opponent be attempt to float upon the wave of distress and discontent from the difficulty we be pass through   we can find what our opponent would do after search the record of their appeal to discontent group and sectional interest   we must search for they in the legislative act which they sponsor and pass in the democratic control house of representatives in the last session of congress   we must look into measure for which they vote and which be defeat   we must inquire whether or not the presidential and vice presidential candidate have disavow these act   if they have not we must conclude that they form a portion and be a substantial indication of the profound change propose
 and we must look still far than this as to what revolutionary change have be propose by the candidate themselves
 we must look into the type of leader who be campaign for the democratic ticket whose philosophy have be well know all their life whose demand for a change in the american system be frank and forceful   i can respect the sincerity of these man in their desire to change our form of government and our social and economic system though i shall do my good tonight to prove they be wrong   i refer particularly to senator norris senator lafollette senator cutting senator huey long senator wheeler william r. hearst and other exponent of a social philosophy different from the traditional american one   unless these man feel assurance of support to their idea they certainly would not be support these candidate and the democratic party   the seal of these man indicate that they have sure confidence that they will have voice in the administration of our government
 i may say at once that the change propose from all these democratic principle and ally be of the most profound and penetrate character   if they be bring about this will not be the american which we have know in the past
 let we pause for a moment and examine the american system of government of social and economic life which it be now propose that we should alter   our system be the product of our race and of our experience in build a nation to height unparalleled in the whole history of the world   it be a system peculiar to the american people   it differ essentially from all other in the world   it be an american system
 it be found on the conception that only through order liberty through freedom to the individual and equal opportunity to the individual will his initiative and enterprise be summon to spur the march of progress
 it be by the maintenance of equality of opportunity and therefore of a society absolutely fluid in freedom of the movement of its human particle that our individualism depart from the individualism of europe   we resent class distinction because there can be no rise for the individual through the frozen strata of class and no stratification of class can take place in a mass liven by the free rise of its particle   thus in our ideal the able and ambitious be able to rise constantly from the bottom to leadership in the community
 this freedom of the individual create of itself the necessity and the cheerful willingness of man to act co operatively in a thousand way and for every purpose as occasion arise and it permit such voluntary co operation to be dissolve as soon as they have serve their purpose to be replace by new voluntary association for new purpose
 there have thus grow within we to gigantic importance a new conception   that is this voluntary co operation within the community   co operation to perfect the social organization co operation for the care of those in distress co operation for the advancement of knowledge of scientific research of education for co operative action in the advancement of many phase of economic life   this be self government by the people outside of government it be the most powerful development of individual freedom and equal opportunity that have take place in the century and a half since our fundamental institution be found
 it be in the further development of this co operation and a sense of its responsibility that we should find solution for many of our complex problem and not by the extension of government into our economic and social life   the great function of government be to build up that co operation and its most resolute action should be to deny the extension of bureaucracy   we have develop great agency of co operation by the assistance of the government which promote and protect the interest of individual and the small unit of business   the federal reserve system in its strengthening and support of the small bank the farm board in its strengthening and support of the farm co operative the home loan bank in the mobilizing of building and loan association and saving bank the federal land bank in give independence and strength to land mortgage association the great mobilization of relief to distress the mobilization of business and industry in measure of recovery and a score of other activity be not socialism&mdash;they be the essence of protection to the development of free man
 the primary conception of this whole american system be not the regimentation of man but the co operation of free man   it be found upon the conception of responsibility of the individual to the community of the responsibility of local government to the state of the state to the national government
 it be found on a peculiar conception of self government design to maintain this equal opportunity to the individual and through decentralization it bring about and maintain these responsibility   the centralization of government will undermine responsibility and will destroy the system
 our government differ from all previous conception not only in this decentralization but also in the separation of function between the legislative executive and judicial arm of government in which the independence of the judicial arm be the keystone of the whole structure
 it be found on a conception that in time of emergency when force be run beyond control of individual or other co operative action beyond the control of local community and of states then the great reserve power of the federal government shall be bring into action to protect the community   but when these force have cease there must be a return of state local and individual responsibility
 the implacable march of scientific discovery with its train of new invention present every year new problem to government and new problem to the social order   question often arise whether in the face of the growth of these new and gigantic tool democracy can remain master in its own house can preserve the fundamental of our american system   i contend that it can and i contend that this american system of our have demonstrate its validity and superiority over any system yet invent by human mind
 it have demonstrate it in the face of the great test of our history&mdash;that be the emergency which we have face in the last three year
 when the political and economic weakness of many nation of europe the result of the world war and its aftermath finally culminate in collapse of their institution the delicate adjustment of our economic and social life receive a shock unparalleled in our history   no one know that well than you of new york   no one know it cause well than you   that the crisis be so great that many of the lead bank seek directly or indirectly to convert their asset into gold or its equivalent with the result that they practically cease to function as credit institution that many of our citizen seek flight for their capital to other country that many of they attempt to hoard gold in large amount   these be but indication of the flight of confidence and of the belief that our government could not overcome these force
 yet these force be overcome&mdash;perhap by narrow margins&mdash;and this action demonstrate what the courage of a nation can accomplish under the resolute leadership in the republican party   and i say the republican party because our opponent before and during the crisis propose no constructive program though some of their member patriotically support ours   later on the democratic house of representatives do develop the real thought and idea of the democratic party but it be so destructive that it have to be defeat for it would have destroy not heal
 in spite of all these obstruction we do succeed   our form of government do prove itself equal to the task   we save this nation from a quarter of a century of chaos and degeneration and we preserve the saving the insurance policy give a fighting chance to man to hold their home   we save the integrity of our government and the honesty of the american dollar   and we instal measure which today be bring back recovery   employment agriculture business&mdash;all of these show the steady if slow healing of our enormous wound
 i therefore contend that the problem of today be to continue these measure and policy to restore this american system to its normal functioning to repair the wound it have receive to correct the weakness and evil which would defeat that system   to enter upon a series of deep change to embark upon this inchoate new deal which have be propound in this campaign would be to undermine and destroy our american system
 before we enter upon such course i would like you to consider what the result of this american system have be during the last thirty years&mdash;that be one single generation   for if it can be demonstrate that by mean of this our unequalled political social and economic system we have secure a lift in the standard of living and a diffusion of comfort and hope to man and woman the growth of equal opportunity the widening of all opportunity such as have never be see in the history of the world then we should not tamper with it or destroy it but on the contrary we should restore it and by its gradual improvement and perfection foster it into new performance for our country and for our child
 now if we look back over the last generation we find that the number of our family and therefore our home have increase from sixteen to twenty five million or 62 per cent   in that time we have build for they 15,000,000 new and well home   we have equip 20,000,000 home with electricity thereby we have lift infinite drudgery from woman and man   the barrier of time and space have be sweep away   life have be make free the intellectual vision of every individual have be expand by the installation of 20,000,000 telephone 12,000,000 radio and the service of 20,000,000 automobile   our city have be make magnificent with beautiful building park and playground   our countryside have be knit together with splendid road   we have increase by twelve time the use of electrical power and thereby take sweat from the back of man   in this broad sweep real wage and purchase power of man and woman have steadily increase   new comfort have steadily come to they   the hour of labor have decrease the 12 hour day have disappear even the 9 hour day have almost go   we be now advance the 5 day week   the portal of opportunity to our child have ever widen   while our population grow by but 62 per cent we have increase the number of child in high school by 700 per cent those in institution of high learning by 300 per cent   with all our spending we multiply by six time the saving in our bank and in our building and loan association   we multiply by 1,200 per cent the amount of our life insurance   with the enlargement of our leisure we have come to a full life we gain new vision of hope we more nearly realize our national aspiration and give increase scope to the creative power of every individual and expansion of every man&#39;s mind
 our people in these thirty year grow in the sense of social responsibility   there be profound progress in the relation of the employer and employ   we have more nearly meet with a full hand the most sacred obligation of man that is the responsibility of a man to his neighbor   support to our school hospital and institution for the care of the afflict surpass in total of billion the proportionate service in any period of history in any nation in the world
 three year ago there come a break in this progress   a break of the same type we have meet fifteen time a century and yet we have overcome they   but eighteen month later come a further blow by shock transmit to we by the earthquake of the collapse in nation throughout the world as the aftermath of the world war   the working of our system be dislocate   million of man and woman be out of job   businessman and farmer suffer   their distress be bitter   i do not seek to minimize the depth of it   we may thank god that in view of this storm 30,000,000 still have their job yet this must not distract our thought from the suffering of the other 10,000,000
 but i ask you what have happen   these thirty year of incomparable improvement in the scale of living the advance of comfort and intellectual life inspiration and ideal do not arise without right principle animate the american system which produce they   shall that system be discard because vote seek man appeal to distress and say that the machinery be all wrong and that it must be abandon or tamper with   be it not more sensible to realize the simple fact that some extraordinary force have be throw into the mechanism temporarily derange its operation   be it not wise to believe that the difficulty be not with the principle upon which our american system be found and design through all these generation of inheritance   should not our purpose be to restore the normal working of that system which have bring to we such immeasurable benefit and not destroy it
 and in order to indicate to you that the proposal of our opponent will endanger or destroy our system i propose to analyze a few of the proposal of our opponent in the relation to these fundamental
 first   a proposal of our opponent which would break down the american system be the expansion of government expenditure by yield to sectional and group raid on the public treasury   the extension of government expenditure beyond the minimum limit necessary to conduct the proper function of the government enslave man to work for the government   if we combine the whole governmental expenditures&mdash;national state and municipal&mdash;we will find that before the world way each citizen work theoretically twenty five day out of each year for the government   today he work for the support of all form of government sixty one day out of the year
 no nation can conscript its citizen for this proportion of men&#39;s time without national impoverishment and destruction of their liberty   our nation can not do it without destruction to our whole conception of the american system   the federal government have be force in this emergency to unusual expenditure but in partial alleviation of these extraordinary and unusual expenditure the republican administration have make a successful effort to reduce the ordinary running expense of the government   our opponent have persistently interfere with such policy   i only need recall to you that the democratic house of representatives pass bill in the last session that would have increase our expenditure by $ 3,500,000,000 or 87 per cent   express in days&#39 labor this would have mean the conscription of sixteen days&#39 additional work from every citizen for the government   this i stop   furthermore they refuse to accept recommendation from the administration in respect to $ 150,000,000 to $ 200,000,000 of reduction in ordinary expenditure and finally they force upon we increase expenditure of $ 322,000,000   in spite of this the ordinary expense of the government have be reduce upwards of $ 200,000,000 during this present administration   they will be decidedly far reduce but the major point i wish to make&mdash;the disheartening part of these proposal of our opponents&mdash;is that they represent successful pressure of minority   they would appeal to sectional and group political support and thereby impose terrific burden upon every home in the country   these thing can and must be resist   but they can only be resist if there shall be live and virile public support to the administration in opposition to political log rolling and the sectional and group raid on the treasury for distribution of public money which be cardinal in the congerie of element which make up the democratic party
 these expenditure propose by the democratic house of representatives for the benefit of special group and special section of our country directly undermine the american system   those who pay be in the last analysis the man who work at the bench the desk and on the farm   they take away his comfort stifle his leisure and destroy his equal opportunity
 second   another proposal of our opponent which would destroy the american system be that of inflation of the currency   the bill which pass the last session of the democratic house call upon the treasure of the united states to issue $ 2,300,000,000 in paper currency that would be unconvertible into solid value   call it what you will greenback or fiat money   it be that nightmare which overhang our own country for year after the civil war
 third   in the last session the congress under the personal leadership of the democratic vice presidential candidate and their ally in the senate enact a law to extend the government into personal banking business   this i be compel to veto out of fidelity to the whole american system of life and government
 fourth   another proposal of our opponent which would wholly alter our american system of life be to reduce the protective tariff to a competitive tariff for revenue   the protective tariff and its result upon our economic structure have become gradually embed into our economic life since the first protective tariff act pass by the american congress under the administration of george washington   there have be gap at time of democratic control when this protection have be take away   but it have be so embed that its removal have never fail to bring disaster
 fifth   another proposal be that the government go into the power business   three year ago in view of the extension of the use of transmission of power over state border and the difficulty of state regulatory body in the face of this interstate action i recommend to the congress that such interstate power should be place under regulation by the federal government in co operation with the state authority
 that recommendation be in accord with the principle of the republican party over the last fifty year to provide regulation where public interest have develop in tool of industry which be beyond control and regulation of the states
 i succeed in create an independent power commission to handle such matter but the democratic house decline to approve the further power to this commission necessary for such regulation
 i have state unceasingly that i be oppose to the federal government go into the power business   i have insist upon rigid regulation   the democratic candidate have declare that under the same condition which may make local action of this character desirable he be prepared to put the federal government into the power business   he be be actively support by a score of senator in this campaign many of whose expense be be pay by the democratic national committee who be pledge to federal government development and operation of electrical power
 i find in the instruction to campaign speaker issue by the democratic national committee that they be instruct to criticize my action in the veto of the bill which would have put the government permanently into the operation of power at muscle shoal with a capital from the federal treasury of over $ 100,000,000   in fact thirty one democratic senators be all except three vote to override that veto   in that bill be the flat issue of the federal government permanently in competitive business   i veto it because of principle and not because it be especially the power business   in the veto i state that i be firmly opposed to the federal government enter into any business the major purpose of which be competition with our citizen   i say
 there be national emergency which require that the government should temporarily enter the field of business but that they must be emergency action and in matter where the cost of the project be secondary to much high consideration   there be many locality where the federal government be justify in the construction of great dam and reservoir where navigation flood control reclamation or stream regulation be of dominant importance and where they be beyond the capacity or purpose of private or local government capital to construct   in these case power be often a by product and should be dispose of by contract or lease   but for the federal government to deliberately go out to build up and expand such an occasion to the major purpose of a power and manufacturing business be to break down the initiative and enterprise of the american people it be destruction of equality of opportunity among our people it be the negation of the ideal upon which our civilization have be base
 this bill raise one of the important issue confront our people that be squarely the issue of federal government ownership and operation of power and manufacturing business not as a minor by product but as a major purpose   involve in this question be the agitation against the conduct of the power industry   the power problem be not to be solve by the federal government go into the power business nor be it to be solve by the project in this bill   the remedy for abuse in the conduct of that industry lie in regulation and not by the federal government enter upon the business itself   i have recommend to the congress on various occasion that action should be take to establish federal regulation of interstate power in co operation with state authority   this bill would launch the federal government upon a policy of ownership of power utility upon a basis of competition instead of by the proper government function of regulation for the protection of all the people   i hesitate to contemplate the future of our institution of our government and of or country if the preoccupation of its official be to be no long the promotion of justice and equal opportunity but be to be devote to barter in the market   that be not liberalism it be degeneration
 from their utterance in this campaign and elsewhere we&rsquo;re justify in the conclusion that our opponent propose to put the federal government in the power business with all its addition to federal bureaucracy its tyranny over state and local government its undermining of state and local responsibility and initiative
 sixth   i may cite another instance of absolutely destructive proposal to our american system by our opponent
 recently there be circulate through the unemployed in this country a letter from the democratic candidate in which he state that he
 would support measure for the inauguration of self liquidate public work such as the utilization of water resource flood control land reclamation to provide employment for all surplus labor at all time
 i especially emphasize that promise to promote employment for all surplus labor at all times.&rdquo   at first i could not believe that any one would be so cruel as to hold out a hope so absolutely impossible of realization to those 10,000,000 who be unemployed   but the authenticity of this promise have be verify   and i protest against such frivolous promise be hold out to a suffer people   it be easily demonstrable that no such employment can be find   but the point i wish to make here and now be the mental attitude and spirit of the democratic party to attempt it   it be another mark of the character of the new deal and the destructive change which mean the total abandonment of every principle upon which this government and the american system be found   if it be possible to give this employment to 10,000,000 people by the government it would cost upwards of $ 9,000,000,00 a year
 i have say before and i want to repeat on this occasion that the only method by which we can stop the suffering and unemployment be by return our people to their normal job in their normal home carry on their normal function of living   this can be do only by sound process of protect and stimulate recovery of the exist economic system upon which we have build our progress thus far&mdash;prevente distress and give such sound employment as we can find in the meantime
 seventh   recently at indianapolis i call attention to the statement make by governor roosevelt in his address on october 25th with respect to the supreme court of the united states   he say
 after march 4 1929 the republican party be in complete control of all branch of the government&mdash;executive senate and house and i may add for good measure in order to make it complete the supreme court as well
 i be not call upon to defend the supreme court of the united states from this slurring reflection   fortunately that court have jealously maintain over the year its high standard of integrity impartiality and freedom from influence of either the executive or congress so that the confidence of the people be sound and unshaken
 but be the democratic candidate really propose his conception of the relation of the executive and the supreme court   if that be his idea he be propose the most revolutionary new deal the most stupendous breaking of precedent the most destructive undermining of the very safeguard of our form of government yet propose by a presidential candidate
 eighth   in order that we may get at the philosophical background of the mind which pronounce the necessity for profound change in our american system and a new deal i would call your attention to an address deliver by the democratic candidate in san francisco early in october
 he say
 our industrial plant be build   the problem just now be whether under exist condition it be not overbuilt   our last frontier have long since be reach   there be practically no more free land   there be no safety valve in the western prairie where we can go for a new start   the mere building of more industrial plant the organization of more corporation be as likely to be as much a danger as a help   our task now be not the discovery of natural resource or necessarily the production of more good it be the sober less dramatic business of administer the resource and plant already in hand establish market for surplus production of meet the problem of under consumption distribute the wealth and product more equitably and adapt the economic organization to the service of the people
 there be many of these expression with which no one would quarrel   but i do challenge the whole idea that we have end the advance of america that this country have reach the zenith of its power the height of its development   that be the counsel of despair for the future of america   that be not the spirit by which we shall emerge from this depression   that be not the spirit that make this country   if it be true every american must abandon the road of countless progress and unlimited opportunity   i deny that the promise of american life have be fulfil for that mean we have begin the decline and fall   no nation can cease to move forward without degeneration of spirit
 if these measure these promise which i have discuss or these failure to disavow these project this attitude of mind mean anything they mean the enormous expansion of the federal government they mean the growth of bureaucracy such as we have never see in our history   no man who have not occupy my position in washington can fully realize the constant battle which must be carry on against incompetence corruption tyranny of government expand into business activity   if we first examine the effect on our form of government of such a program we come at once to the effect of the most gigantic increase in expenditure ever know in history   that alone would break down the saving the wage the equality of opportunity among our people   these measure would transfer vast responsibility to the federal government from the states the local government and the individual   but that be not all they would break down our form of government   our legislative body can not delegate their authority to any dictator but without such delegation every member of these body be impel in representation of the interest of his constituent constantly to seek privilege and demand service in the use of such agency   every time the federal government extend its arm 531 senators and congressman become actual board of director of that business
 capable man can not be choose by politic for all the various talent require   even if they be superman if there be no politic in the selection of the congress if there be no constant pressure for this and for that so large a number would be incapable as a board of director of any institution   at once when these extension take place by the federal government the authority and responsibility of state government and institution be undermine   every enterprise of private business be at once halt to know what federal action be go to be   it destroy initiative and courage   we can do no well than quote that great statesman of labor the late samuel gompers in speak of a similar situation
 it be a question of whether it shall be government ownership or private ownership under control   if i be a minority of one in this convention i would want to cast my vote so that the man of labor shall not willingly enslave themselves to government in their industrial effort
 we have hear a great deal in this campaign about reactionary conservative progressive liberal and radical   i have not yet hear an attempt by any one of the orator who mouth these phrase to define the principle upon which they base these classification   there be one thing i can say without any question of doubt&mdash;that it that the spirit of liberalism be to create free man it be not the regimentation of man   it be not the extension of bureaucracy   i have say in this city before now that you can not extend the mastery of government over the daily life of a people without somewhere make it master of people&#39; soul and thought   expansion of government in business mean that the government in order to protect itself from the political consequence of its error be drive irresistibly without peace to great and great control of the nation&#39;s press and platform   free speech do not live many hour after free industry and free commerce die   it be a false liberalism that interpret itself into government operation of business   every step in that direction poison the very root of liberalism   it poison political equality free speech free press and equality of opportunity   it be the road not to liberty but to less liberty   true liberalism be find not i strive to spread bureaucracy but in strive to set bound to it   true liberalism seek all legitimate freedom first in the confident belief that without such freedom the pursuit of other blessing be in vain liberalism be a force truly of the spirit proceed from the deep realization that economic freedom can not be sacrifice if political freedom be to be preserve
 even if the government conduct of business could give we the maximum of efficiency instead of least efficiency it would be purchase at the cost of freedom   it would increase rather than decrease abuse and corruption stifle initiative and invention undermine development of leadership cripple mental and spiritual energy of our people extinguish equality of opportunity and dry up the spirit of liberty and progress   man who be go about this country announce that they be liberal because of their promise to extend the government in business be not liberal they be reactionary of the united states
 and i do not wish to be misquote or misunderstood   i do not mean that our government be to part with one iota of its national resource without complete protection to the public interest   i have already state that democracy must remain master in its own house   i have state that abuse and wrongdoing must be punish and control   nor do i wish to be misinterpret as state that the united states be a free for all and devil ndash;take the hindermost society
 the very essence of equality of opportunity of our american system be that there shall be no monopoly or domination by any group or section in this country whether it be business sectional or a group interest   on the contrary our american system demand economic justice as well as political and social justice it be not a system of laissez faire
 i be not set up the contention that our american system be perfect   no human ideal have ever be perfectly attain since humanity itself be not perfect   but the wisdom of our forefather and the wisdom of the thirty man who have precede i in this office hold to the conception that progress can be attain only as the sum of accomplishment of free individual and they have hold unalterably to these principle
 in the ebb and flow of economic life our people in time of prosperity and ease naturally tend to neglect the vigilance over their right   moreover wrongdoing be obscure by apparent success in enterprise   then insidious disease and wrongdoing grow apace   but we have in the past see in time of distress and difficulty that wrongdoing and weakness come to the surface and our people in their endeavor to correct these wrong be tempt to extreme which may destroy rather than build
 it be man who do wrong not our institution   it be man who violate the law and public right   it be man not institution who must be punish
 in my acceptance speech four year ago at palo alto i state that&mdash
 one of the old aspiration of the human race be the abolition of poverty   by poverty i mean the grind by under nourishment cold ignorance fear of old age to those who have the will to work
 i state that&mdash
 in america today we be near a final triumph over poverty than in any land   the poorhouse have vanish from among we we have not reach that goal but give a chance to go forward we shall with the help of god be in sight of the day when poverty will be banish from this nation
 my countryman the proposal of our opponent represent a profound change in american life&mdash;less in concrete proposal bad as that may be than by implication and by evasion   dominantly in their spirit they represent a radical departure from the foundation of 150 year which have make this the great nation in the world   this election be not a mere shift from the in to the out   it mean decide the direction our nation will take over a century to come
 my conception of america be a land where man and woman may walk in order liberty where they may enjoy the advantage of wealth not concentrate in the hand of a few but diffuse through the life of all where they build and safeguard their home give to their child full opportunity of american life where every man shall be respect in the faith that his conscience and his heart direct he to follow where people secure in their liberty shall have leisure and impulse to seek a full life   that lead to the release of the energy of man and woman to the wide vision and high hope it lead to opportunity for great and great service not alone of man to man in our country but from our country to the world   it lead to health in body and a spirit unfettere youthful eager with a vision stretch beyond the farth horizon will an open mind sympathetic and generous   but that must be build upon our experience with the past upon the foundation which have make our country great   it must be the product of our truly american system
my fellow citizen my friend in indianapolis and may i also include senator watson for i wish to add that he must be your next senator we require his service in washington

 now my fellow citizen my major purpose tonight be to discuss those long view policy by which we not only cement recovery but also by which we secure over the year the enlarge comfort and the steady progress of the american people i propose to contrast they with the idea which have be develop by the democratic house of representatives the democratic platform and the democratic candidate in the course of this campaign

 when i refer to the view of these group i wish to say at once that i do not refer to all member of the democratic party many of they as in 1896 and in 1928 have signify their intention to support we against these notion i also wish on all occasion to pay tribute to those democratic members of the congress who support the unprecedented measure which we present during the course of the last winter and through which we save this country from destruction and chaos

 i would like also to reiterate the statement which i recently make at detroit that the most important issue before the american people right now be to overcome this crisis that we may secure a restoration of normal job to our unemployed recovery of our agricultural price and of our business and that we may extend generous help in the meantime to tide our people over until these fundamental restoration be establish

 i point out on that occasion that the battle have now change from a successful defense of our country from disaster and chaos to forward march attack on a hundred front through a score of instrumentality and weapon toward recovery since that time i have have further positive evidence show that the measure and policy that we have set in motion be drive the force of depression into further retreat with constantly increase rapidity if there shall be no change in the strategy of this battle if there shall be no delay and hesitation we shall have the restoration of man and woman to their normal job and we shall have that lift to agriculture from its anxiety and its loss

 but before i begin the major discussion of the evening i wish to take a moment of your time to revert to those method and policy for protection and recovery from this depression in the light of certain recent misstatement of the democratic candidate in respect to they

 i presume the governor of new york will announce that i be act upon the defensive if i shall expose the self interested inexactitude which he have broadcast to the american people i be equally prepared to defend attack or expound i shall not be deter from my purpose to lay before the people of the united states the truth as to the issue which they confront and i shall do it with a sense of responsibility of one who have carry out and must carry into effect these issue

 i wish to call your attention to the fact that the governor of new york in a speech on october 25 state

 this crash come in october 1929 the president have at his disposal all of the instrumentality of the government from that day until december 31 1931 he do absolutely nothing to remedy the situation not only do he do nothing but he take the position that congress could do nothing

 that be the end of the quotation and it be a charge which extend over the first 2 year and 2 month of this depression it seem almost incredible that a man a candidate for the presidency of the united states would broadcast such a violation of the truth the front page of every newspaper in the united states for the whole of those 2 year proclaim the untruth of that statement and i need remind you but of a few act of the administration to demonstrate what i say

 the governor dismiss the agreement bring about between the leader of industry and labor under my assistance less than 1 month after the crash by which wage of literally million of man and woman be for the first time in 15 depression of a century hold without reduction until after profit have cease and the cost of living have decrease

 he ignore the fact that today real wage in the united states be high than at any other depression period high in purchase power than in any other country in the world and above all he dismiss the heal effect of that great agreement by which this country have be keep free from industrial strife and class conflict

 he would suppress from the american people the knowledge of the undertaking bring about within 2 month after the crash amongst the industry of the united states to divide the exist work in such fashion as to give million of family some measure of income instead of discharge a large portion of they into destitution as have always be the case in previous depression and be the case abroad he ignore the fact that these agreement have hold until this day for the staggering oœ employment

 if the governor will look up his own file of his official correspondence he will find that within a month after the crash i appeal to he amongst the other governor for cooperation in create employment and stabilization of wage in which i set out to he the gravity of the national situation and urge that he should present in turn the great need to the county and city of his state if he say nothing be do it be a violation of the promise which he write to i on that occasion

 nevertheless the other states and the municipality include the great state of indiana enter into the general definite organization between the states to increase construction work in relief of unemployment during the winter not only of 1930 but of 1931 not only be federal state and municipal agency mobilize but private agency be mobilize to that end and by this the governor seem to have forget i succeed in reverse the whole usual process of decrease construction work of this character in time of depression

 this type of work be increase during the first year of the depression by over $ 800 million above normal thus give a living to thousand of family who otherwise would have be destitute

 the governor say nothing have be do the governor would also suppress the fact of the mobilization of the american people under my direction during the winter of 1930 and 31 of private charity and of public support to relief of distress in every town village and hamlet in the united states through which we carry they over these winter without serious suffering or loss as be prove by the public health statistic of today

 the governor can not be ignorant of the recommendation which i make to the congress within a month after the crash and again in the session a year later for the great increase of federal public work in aid of employment and he can not be ignorant of the appropriation make at my recommendation for the care of farmer stricken by drought or the public fund raise under my leadership for these purpose

 the governor ignore the most patent fact in the history of this depression that under the wise policy pursue by this administration recovery of the united states from the first phase of the depression that be the collapse from our own speculation and boom begin about a year after the crash and continue definitely and positively until april 1931 when the general world crash take place which be not of our doing

 the governor be probably ignorant of the international measure take to limit the extension of this prairie fire under american leadership he ignore the german moratorium and the standstill agreement in june 1931 which not only save germany from complete collapse but prevent much of the extended distress from reach the united states he neglect the creation after the collapse of england of the national credit corporation with a capital of $ 500 million in cooperation amongst american bank which save over 700 institution involve the deposit of upwards of 10 million of our people and that be do something

 the governor entirely misrepresent the fact that the plan to meet this crisis which sweep upon we from europe be propose by i to the political leader of the united states at a white house conference on october 6 1931 he ignore the fact that that plan be lay before the congress by a message on december 8 and that it be not the creation of the democratic leader at the end of december as he would imply although the leader of the democratic party have promise 14 month before they would produce a plan they produce no plan until they begin their destructive program some month later and not one of those act have be disavow by the governor he ignore the fact that the unprecedented measure propose and carry through by the administration with the help of some of the democratic colleague in the congress would have put we on the road to recovery 8 month ago instead of having have to await the adjournment of the democratic house of representatives only 4 month ago

 and again the governor despite every proof keep reiterate the implication that the measure take by this administration have have no fruitful result to the common man he have be tell at least by some of the man who advise he in this campaign that the gigantic crisis with which the united states be face be escape by the narrow margin and that it be due to unprecedented measure adopt by this administration if some of these man will tell he the whole truth they will tell he that they personally seek to buy and withdraw large sum of gold because of their belief that we could not maintain the gold reserve of the united states

 would it not be well that every american citizen should take pride in the fact that america carry this nation through this crisis safely and soundly and do it as a matter of national and united action

 why can not the governor of new york be frank enough to recognize the successful care of the distressed in the united states that a vast amount of employment have be provide by cooperative action amongst our citizen that the saving of more than 95 percent of the depositor in our bank have be hold secure that the 20 million borrower who otherwise would have be bankrupt by destructive pressure from forced selling of their asset in order to pay their debt have be protect that the 70 million life insurance policy which represent the great act of self denial of a people in provision for the future safety of their love one have be sustain in their vitality and foreclosure of hundred of thousand of mortgage upon home and farm have be prevent those be national accomplishment for which the whole american people be proud

 the governor know that the integrity of our currency have be sustain that the credit of the federal government have be maintain that credit and employment be be expand day by day

 the live proof of these measure which be conceive from the human heart as well as the human mind can be find in the man and woman in every city every town every township and every block in this broad land for they have be save their job and their home and secure from suffer and that by the action of the american people as a whole

 i have state that my major purpose this evening be to speak upon some of the continue policy of this administration and the republican party in contrast with the policy of our opponent

 many of these continue policy be deal with in our platform i deal with some of they in my acceptance speech some have develop in the course of this campaign having have the responsibility of this office for 30 year my view upon most public question be already set out in many case in the public record and by definite public action i do not have to engage in promise in respect to they i may point to performance

 the opposition have show its true purpose by its legislation in the last session of the democratic house of representatives through their platform and through the statement or evasion of their candidate

 of these subject i may first refer to the tariff

 in a recent speech in discuss the agricultural tariff i point out the specific disaster to our farm from the democratic proposal to reduce the protective tariff i point out that the democratic party have in 1913 not be content with merely lower the tariff but have put a large part of the farm product on the free list i point out that the republican party have pass an emergency farm tariff bill in 1921 as soon as they have a majority in the congress and that a democratic president have veto it i point out that the democratic minority in congress in 1921 have vote against the revival of the emergency farm tariff and that the republican majority have pass it and a republican president have sign it i point out that the democratic minority have vote against an increase in agricultural tariff in the republican tariff act of 1922 i point out that most of the democratic members of congress vote against the bill carry the increase in tariff on agricultural product in the special session of congress which i call in 1929 for that purpose on which occasion we pass the hawley smoot bill

 in the light of this historic attitude it be but natural that our opponent express their bitter opposition to the republican tariff they have habitually vote against these tariff and now they propose in their platform a competitive tariff for revenue and they denounce the smoot haw ley bill which be mainly devoted to the increase of farm tariff the democratic candidate from the day of his nomination iterate and reiterate that he propose to reduce the tariff he state that it be an unwarranted increase in the tariff

 during the first 7 week of this campaign he not only adopt the historic position of his party but he constantly repeat their platform and have reinforce it by repeat statement as for instance

 i support the competitive tariff for revenue

 the tariff law of 1932 be a drastic revision of the tariff upward in spite of the fact that the exist tariff level be already high enough to protect american industry

 we sit on the high wall of the hawley smoot tariff

 i condemn the hawley smoot tariff

 a wicked and exorbitant tariff

 seal by the high tariff in the history of the world

 our policy declare for lower tariff

 a ghastly jest of the tariff

 mr. roosevelt and his party know that the major increase in the hawley smoot act be farm tariff when that platform be draw and he know it be in effect when he make the statement that i have quote the evidence be complete that he and they intend to reduce the farm tariff

 during the past 3 week i have reiterate this plain and evident purpose of their party and their candidate unquestionably my exposition have give their candidate great anxiety because on the 25th of this month some 6 or 7 day ago just 21 day after my first statement on the subject he announce another new deal i call this a new shuffle he now announce within 2 week of the election that he do not propose to reduce tariff on farm product

 this be the most startling shift in position by a presidential candidate in the midst of a political campaign in all recent political history what do you think grover cleveland or samuel tilden or woodrow wilson would have say to such a shift as that do the candidate realize that he have overnight throw overboard the great historic position of his party that he have rewrite the democratic platform do he realize that he must withdraw large part of the speech in which he have denounce this hawley smoot bill as the origin of all the world 's calamity

 i have the privilege of inform he that 66 percent of all the duty collect on all of the import into the united states be directly on import of agricultural origin and the reduction of which would affect american farmer

 be we to take it that all the diatribe we have hear from the democratic orator throughout this campaign be in respect to only one third of the american tariff for just 7 day ago the democratic candidate say the hawley smoot tariff law carry the decline in world trade and what amount to a world calamity become a general international calamity since that time he must have conclude that the farm tariff have do the world no harm

 you will far remember that under the tariff act two third of our import be free of duty and now he exclude two third of the remain one third that be dutiable do the democratic party now pretend that this terrible world calamity which we have encounter be cause by the tariff on one ninth of the import into the united states and far do they know and they do know that of this one ninth of the import of nonagricultural commodity less than one half of they be increase by the hawley smoot tariff bill

 now to continue our mathematical exploration a little far i be wonder if they pretend that this calamity be cause by increase of tariff on one eighteenth of the import of the united states and i may pursue this mathematical course still far do they recognize that the whole of our import that is the import of the united states constitute less than 12 percent of the import of the world all take together and thus in this revised view the increase duty on one eighteenth of one twelfth or less than one half of 1 percent of the world 's import trade bring about this gigantic calamity by which 30 nation fail or go to revolution

 should not the democratic candidate now at last search in the aftermath of the world war for the origin of our difficulty and stop this nonsense

 i wish to extend this discussion a little far it be desirable that the governor may explain himself some far on other tariff question do he include the reduction of the tariff on cotton textile so largely manufacture in the south i have include but a part of the textile duty in the agricultural tariff the tariff on agricultural product inasmuch as only a part of the raw cotton be dutiable and i wonder whether he propose to close up the southern cotton mill

 in view of this new light of maintain tariff i wonder if he have consider the grievous position that the oil industry might be in in the states of california oklahoma texas and kansas if they be leave out have he consider the copper industry in the states of arizona montana michigan and utah have he consider the tariff on metal and other product which affect the welfare of the whole of the people of new england new york pennsylvania california new jersey ohio indiana illinois west virginia and other states have he consider the tariff on pottery and chemical and its effect upon new jersey ohio indiana illinois new york pennsylvania west virginia california and a lot of other state and will he consider the tariff on lumber and their effect on oregon washington california and wisconsin if we be go to retreat from a reduction of the tariff those people ought to have some word of comfort also

 perhaps if he would give the same consideration as to the effect of reduce the tariff for these other people he will come to the same conclusion as that which he have be force to come by this debate in respect to agriculture now if political exigency have force this temporary conversion on agricultural product how far be the governor authorize to change at will the traditional policy and the platform of the democratic party how far can he guarantee to bring with he the democratic members of the house and the senate who vote against the bill carry the increase in agricultural tariff and how about the man who write that plank in the democratic platform now do you who be farmer believe in eleventh hour conversion do you consider that your livelihood be safe in the hand of the traditional and the present enemy of the protective tariff

 perhaps the governor and the whole democratic party will now withdraw and apologize for the defamation to which i have be subject for the past 2 year because i call a special session of the congress and secure an increase in agricultural tariff

 now i be myself take heart over this debate if it could be continue long enough i believe we could drive he from every solitary position he have take in this campaign they be equally untenable but even on the tariff he perhaps remember the dreadful experience of the chameleon on the scotch plaid and i can illustrate this to you

 as to the balance of the protective tariff unless this late conversion extend far than agriculture he propose to reduce they in the face of the fact that during the last 12 month there have be a violent change in the economy of the entire world through the depreciation of currency in some 30 european nation and thus a lowering of their standard of living and the creation of still great difference between the cost of production in the united states and abroad

 now the republican party be squarely for the protective tariff i refuse to put the american worker and farmer into further unemployment and misery by any such action as the unrepented principle of their member of the democratic congress and their platform

 the governor 's new shuffle however require that he give some further assurance to our farmer in order to make it consistent the democratic house of representatives and their ally in the senate pass a bill direct i to call an international conference for the purpose of reduce tariff the governor have support this in his program that mean that we should surrender to foreigner the determination of a policy which we have zealously hold under american control for nearly 150 year ever since the first protective tariff be enact under george washington 's administration this would in that manner place the fate of american worker and american farmer in the hand of foreign nation and i veto the bill

 but the point that i wish to make now be that the governor should give to the farmer that if he call this conference which he have assure he will do that he will exempt agricultural tariff from the discussion therein

 far than this the democratic party and their candidate propose to enter upon reciprocal tariff that idea be not entirely new in our history although it be a violation of what have now become a firmly fix principle of uniform and equal treatment of all nation without preference concession or discrimination it be just such concession and discrimination that be produce today a large part of the friction over tariff in europe i suppose our democratic friend blame these european tariff war on the hawley smoot bill

 though reciprocal tariff be a violation of well establish american principle this nation have fall from grace at time and attempt to do this very thing at one time 22 such treaty be negotiate for this purpose congress refuse to confirm 16 of they 2 of the remain fail of confirmation by other government and 4 other be so immaterial as to be forget on another occasion congress confer on the executive a limited authority to make treaty of this character twenty two of they be agree upon all of which be repeal by tariff act now this demonstrate just one thing that in an intelligent democracy you can not surrender the welfare of one industry or one locality in order to gain something for another

 but there be an overriding objection to a reciprocal tariff upon which the governor 's new shuffle require that he give these further assurance to the farmer the vast majority of the wish of foreign country about our tariff be to get we to reduce our farm tariff so that they may enter our agricultural market the only concession that we could grant through reciprocal tariff of any great importance would be at the cost of our farmer since the governor have assure the nation of a policy of reciprocal tariff he should give an assurance to the farmer that the farm tariff will not be include and that he will abandon the whole idea of reciprocal tariff in relation to agriculture this of course take away the whole foundation of the trading value in reciprocal tariff and we may as well abandon the further discussion of that in this campaign

 in all this discussion about reduce tariff it should be remember that if any one of the rate or schedule in our tariff be too high it have be open to our opponent during the whole of the last session of the house of representatives to pass a simple resolution and thereby secure its review by the tariff commission do they do that they do not

 the establishment of the tariff commission with this authority destroy one of the campaign method of the democratic party and that be to conduct their campaign by exhibit kettle and pan to the housewife of the nation and explain what unjust cost be impose upon they by the tariff now that maneuver be no long effective with the bipartisan tariff commission open to give remedy to the housewife of the united states

 the democrats propose in fact pass a bill in the last session in the low house to destroy the authority of the bipartisan tariff commission by which it may change the tariff so as to correct inequity or to alter the schedule to meet the change tide of an economic world thus they propose to return to the old logrolling the old orgy of greed viciousness and stagnation of business during general congressional action in review of the tariff

 the increase authority to the bipartisan tariff commission to make change in the tariff with the approval of the president be bring about at my insistence and with the sterling courage of your senator 2 year ago that be the great reform in tariff legislation in half a century and it originate from theodore roosevelt

 no well example of the vital importance of the flexible tariff exist than today when we be in the crisis of man and woman be throw out of employment due to depreciate currency abroad and of low price farm product move over our border the commission be today reexamine the new difference in the cost of production at home and abroad that action may be take to restore man and woman to their job

 sound public policy maintain the necessity of this commission and its authority the democratic policy be to destroy it but perhaps the governor of new york will offer we a new deal in this matter also

 now relate to the tariff the democratic candidate propose to place the payment of the war debt owe to we by foreign country squarely on the shoulder of the american workman and the american farmer by lower the tariff for this special purpose he would let down the bar to the american market for foreign commodity to the extent necessary that foreign nation may collect from the profit of their manufacture the money with which to pay these debt will he now exclude the 66 percent of dutiable import which be farm product from this proposal

 my own view in opposition to cancellation of the war debt be a matter of public record through many public statement and message to congress i have propose that if opportunity offer we should use the foreign debt payment by payment to expand foreign market for our labor and our own farmer that be not cancellation and that be the reverse of the announce policy of the democratic candidate

 at no point in this campaign have our opponent state clearly and definitely their position on immigration i have look for it i may have overlook it if i have i apologize i have state that i favor rigidly restrict immigration i endeavor to secure from the congress the return of the quota basis from the national origin to the base previously give i have recommend that a more humane provision should be make for bring in the near relative of our citizen i shall persist in these matter

 i have limit immigration by administrative order during the depression in order to relieve we of unemployment or alternatively to save the job of our people who be now at work two year prior to that order go into effect slightly under half a million immigrant come into the united states since it go into effect more have go out of the united states than have come in the distressed people with lower standard of living that would have come in would have be a far great addition to our unemployed than even this amount the democratic candidate incidentally overlook that little item in state that the republican administration have do nothing in the first 2 year and 2 month of this depression

 i have repeatedly recommend to the congress a revision of our railway transportation law in order that we might create great stability and great assurance in this vital service of transportation the regulation should be extend to other form of carrier both to prevent the cutthroat destruction go on in their own business amongst themselves and to prevent their destruction of the other great major arm of our transportation i have set this matter out in numerous message to the congress i have support the recommendation of the interstate commerce commission which be specific and not generality our opponent have adopt my program in this matter during this campaign except for certain glittering generalization as to which they do not inform we how they be to be accomplish and upon which i enter a reservation

 i have repeatedly recommend the federal regulation of interstate power i state as early as 7 year ago that glass pocket be the safety of the industry as well as of the public i secure the creation of an independent power commission by congress 2 year ago under the leadership of your senator i have oppose and i will continue to oppose the federal government go into the power business and the further extension of federal bureaucracy

 the intention of many of the man at least that be campaign for the democratic party and under the auspex of and with money provide by the democratic national committee be certainly to put the government into the power business and it would seem that they must have confidence that their notion will be put over by the democratic candidate

 the democratic candidate assure we that he will preserve the great water power of the country for the people that be already provide by the law pass 20 year ago pass in 1920 -and it therefore present no difficulty to vigorous campaign promise

 in my acceptance speech i state that this depression have expose many weakness in our economic system it have show much wrongdoing there have be exploitation and abuse of financial power these weakness must be correct and that wrongdoing must be punish we will continue to reform such abuse and correct such wrongdoing as fall within the power of the federal government

 furthermore the american people must have protection from insecure banking through a strong banking system they must have relief from condition which permit the credit machinery of the country be make available without adequate check for wholesale speculation in security with its ruinous consequence to million of our citizen and to our national economy this the federal reserve system by its present constitution have prove incapable of bring about i recommend to the congress the sane reform of our banking law the democratic house of representatives do not see fit to pass that legislation in the last session but we shall persist until it have be accomplish

 about a year ago i recommend to the congress an emergency relief to our depositor in close bank that through temporary use of the credit of the federal government a substantial portion of their asset should be forthwith distribute in order to relieve distress and to enable depositor to reestablish their business the democratic congress refuse to pass such legislation in the last session except for a minor provision of authority to the reconstruction corporation which do not reach to the heart of the question

 the democratic candidate and his corp of orator have not yet disclose their position on this subject it concern the welfare of 4 or 5 million americans

 we have listen to much prattle from the opposition about reduce government expense have a record of earnest performance i naturally expose those insincerity in the last address which i make at detroit

 my only comment on this occasion be that if i receive a mandate from the american people in this election i shall be able not only to force upon this democratic house real economy but i shall be able to stop further raid by the democratic party on the treasury of the united states

 now through some misinformation present to he the democratic candidate have annex as if it be a new discovery the recommendation which i make in 1922 and have be continuously advocate ever since for the reorganization of the whole federal administrative structure for purpose of economy by consolidation of bureaus and the elimination of useless board and commission the candidate in a speech 3 day ago be thus lead to misrepresent the present situation in suggest that i have these power have not execute they he do not realize that the congress having no long be able to oppose this reform do pass a measure during the last session grant such an authority to the executive to bring it about they however deny my request for immediate action except on minor question and make that authority dependent upon the approval of the congress which can not be give before next march under the term of the law if the democratic candidate will read the law and inform himself fully on the subject i have no doubt he will withdraw that statement

 i recently give an address at des moines devote largely to specific measure now in action and to be put in action for agriculture

 i also likewise at cleveland give an extended exposition of the measure and policy which we have in action and propose for labor and employment i be in hope that these statement may be carefully consider and our time be too short this evening to go into those item in detail although i hope to take they up again in this campaign

 one of the most important issue of the campaign arise from the fact that the democratic candidate have not yet disavow the bill pass by the democratic house of representatives under the leadership of the democratic candidate for vice president to issue $ 2,300 million of greenback currency that be unconvertible paper money that be money purport to come from the horn of plenty but with the death 's head engrave upon it tamper with the currency have become a perennial policy of the democratic party the republican party have have to repel that many time before now in the absence of any declaration by the democratic candidate on this subject during 7 week of this campaign no delayed promise now can efface that policy the taint of it be firmly embed in the democratic party and the danger be embed in this election if you want to know what this new deal and this sort of money do to a people ask any of your neighbor who have relative in europe especially in germany

 i have state that i do not favor the prepayment of the soldier bonus of $ 2,300 million it be pass by the last democratic house of representatives it will no doubt be attempt again the democratic candidate have not yet state to the american people fairly and squarely what his attitude will be upon that subject

 the reason why i do not approve of it can be illustrate by the father who in a generous moment promise his young son a bonus of $ 100 when he be 21 year old that boy be lead to ask his father for the $ 100 13 year in advance his father say times be bad i be hard press i have to bring up and educate a great many child and i have not the money i be place $ 5 per annum in the saving bank and as it be compound it will amount to the $ 100 when you be 21 year old some of his friend add that he might pay the boy in stage money

 now the moral of that story be that you can not eat your loaf of compound interest before the dough have have time to rise and the further political moral of that story be that it be say by the father 's political opponent that his son would never vote for his father for public office

 there be no one in high public office who know well than i do from personal observation the service give by the youth of this country in the great war i have insist upon their care when in distress i have expand the service give to the veteran at the cost of much personal criticism but with all of my regard and my feeling i can not endanger the stability of this country in this special demand of a part of the veteran or any other special group

 someone just ask the difference between this payment and the loan give by the reconstruction corporation there be just this difference one of they be a large gift from the government and the other be loan upon security for a period of 6 month only

 but of one thing i will assure the veteran and that be when they be pay they will be pay in real american money

 during the past few week the democratic candidate have have a great deal to say in endeavor to establish the idea in the mind of the american people that i be personally responsible for the bad loan by american banker and investor to numerous foreign country he say this be an unsavory chapter in american finance i agree with part of that these bond be in large part the fruit of the distressing policy pursue by the present administration in washington none other if you please than the ability of lend to backward and crippled country that be the end of the quotation from he

 the governor do not inform the american people that there be no federal law regulate the sale of security and that there be doubtful constitutional authority for such a law and he fail to state that most of these bond be issue from the state of new york which sovereignty have such an authority and where the government have do nothing of a reform to that evil if it be one i recollect a republican governor of new york who believe that wrong be be do to the citizen of his own and other states on life insurance find a man name charles evans hughes who clean that mess up once and for all

 the governor have not state to the american people my oft repeat warning that american loan make in foreign country should be upon sound security and confine to reproductive purpose i have define these loan as be the loan make for creative enterprise on which their own earning would repay interest and capital in one of his address the governor pretend at least not to understand what a reproductive loan be and yet as i will show you in a moment he do know something about it i will say at once that when we have surplus capital properly secure loan for reproductive purpose abroad be an advantage to the american people they furnish work to american labor in the manufacture of plant and equipment they furnish continue demand for american labor in supply and replacement the effect of such creative enterprise be to increase the standard of live amongst the people in those locality and enable they to buy more american products and furnish additional work for american labor

 i have no apology to make for that statement it be sound it make for the upbuilding of the world it make for employment of american workman and profit for american investor if it be follow there would be no loss in these statement make by the governor he entirely omit the condition and warning with which i have repeatedly surround the statement upon this subject and the warning which indeed i have give broadcast over the last 7 year in respect to this type of investment although no federal official have any authority to control the security offer on these loan none of they have default where the safeguard propose by i have be follow

 it be obvious from the governor 's many speech that he now consider that all foreign loan be wrong he seem to consider the selling of foreign bond in our country to be wicked and the cause of our calamity and an interesting part of all this tirade be that i have never yet be engage in the selling of foreign bond and foreign loan i have not be accuse of that the governor however have an advantage over i in experience in that particular as late as 1928 the governor be engage in that business for profit and actively occupy in promotion of such loan at that time he be the chairman of the organization committee of the federal international banking company a corporation organize for the selling of foreign security and bond to the american people i have in my hand a prospectus of that corporation in which the foreword write by mr. roosevelt before he resign that position to take the governorship read as follow

 the organizer of the federal international banking company feel that foreign investment be in the nature of alliance the federal international banking company will provide a new source of supply from which american demand for foreign investment may be satisfied it be intend to promote the expansion of american foreign trade investment in the federal international banking be intend to be self liquidating it will be put to sound protective use a part of the surplus capital of our nation

 its operation can be widely distribute in foreign country and various industry

 that we must aid foreign debtor to purchase our product rehabilitate themselves expand and develop and earn money with which to liquidate their debt that foreign loan should be facilitate to aid the export sale of american product

 now i will ask you if any more vivid statement of the policy which i have just pronounce to you be ever make than that

 throughout this prospectus constant reference be make to the fact that it be organize under the law and the impression be give that in consequence it have some sort of official blessing from the federal government include quotation from myself

 i have no reason to believe i do not believe that the governor 's enterprise on this occasion be not perfectly proper and be soundly rounded i do not wish to convey any such an impression but the governor as a private promoter for profit during the boom of 1928 believe and practice what the governor a presidential candidate now denounce immoral and a cause of our calamity

 two week ago at cleveland i feel it be necessary to denounce certain calumny be circulate in this campaign by the democratic national committee in official instruction to their campaign speaker that committee privately acknowledge that these have not a shred of foundation and yet they refuse to take the manly course and withdraw those statement they have seek to maintain their continue poison by silence

 i now have before i other calumny of the democratic national committee circulate in the same fashion by instruction to their campaign speaker these instruction bristle with title such as these and these question will interest american woman they be entitle

 how president hoover have fail child

 his real interest in the nation 's child may be gain by his re corded effort to emasculate and disrupt the children 's bureau

 the bunk of the home loan bank

 governor roosevelt imply his endorsement of these calumny by repeat these implication in his speech when he speak of what he call attempt that have be make to cut appropriation for child welfare

 and again when he state that the united states public health service have say that over 6 million of our public school child have not enough to eat many of they be faint at their desk they be the prey of disease and their future health be menace

 in another speech he utter a slur on the home loan banking system create by this administration largely through the leadership of your senator

 these thing have importance only as indicate the desperate attempt to mislead the american voter no woman in the united states believe that i be call upon to defend my interest in child over the past score of year but more to the point of this discussion i have a letter from the chief of the united states public health service to the effect that no such statement as that quote by governor roosevelt have ever be put out by he or by that service furthermore i have an address only a week old by the president of the american public health association who be not a government official say that by and large the health oœ the people as measure in sickness and in death have never be well in the history of the united states despite this depression that show the devoted work of thousand of american woman and man whom his statement in this campaign seek to slur

 as to the children 's bureau i may demonstrate the untruth of that statement by the fact that the first year of my administration despite hard time i increase the appropriation of that bureau from $ 320,000 to $ 368,000 which be every cent the bureau ask for and in the second year i recommend appropriation of $ 399,000 which be every cent they say they could advantageously spend and in the third year i recommend appropriation of $ 395,000 but the democratic house of representatives reduce this by $ 20,000 that scarcely look like an attempt to ruin the children 's bureau especially on my part

 in the matter of the home loan bank the governor state that this idea be bring out in the middle of the campaign and like the instruction to speaker send out by the democratic national committee he make slur upon it that statement fall a little to the ground in the same slough of untruth as the other when it be recollect that i round the better homes movement in the united states more than 10 year ago whose activity in over 9,000 different community through the devoted service of thousand of american woman finally blossom into the white house conference on home building and home ownership more than a year ago on that occasion i propose and secure the backing of the man and woman of the united states for the plan which ultimately result in the home loan bank and that bill be draft and present to congress in december last the refusal of the democratic house of representatives to act prevent its passage until the last hour of the session 8 month later and then only when the pressure from the woman and the man devote to the upbuilding of the american home have become so great that they dare not defeat it in the face of this political campaign

 have that bill be pass when it be introduce nearly a year ago the suffering and loss of thousand of small homeowner in the united states would have be prevent i consider that that act be the great act yet undertake by any government at any time on behalf of thousand of owner of small home it provide the machinery through the mobilization of building and loan association and saving bank by which we may assure to man and woman the opportunity to bring up their child in the surrounding which make for true unity and true purpose in american life

 now in conclusion in governor roosevelt 's address deliver on october 25 he state

 after march 4 1929 the republican party be in complete control of all branch of the government executive senate and house and i may add for good measure the supreme court as well

 i invite your attention to that statement about the supreme court there be many thing reveal in this campaign by our opponent which should give american citizen concern for the future one of the grave be the state of mind reveal by my opponent in that statement he imply that it be the function of a party in power to control the supreme court for generation the republican and democratic presidents alike have make it their most sacred duty to respect and maintain the independence of america 's great tribunal president taft appoint a democratic chief justice president harding mate a democratic justice my last appointment be a democrat from the state of new york whose appointment be applaud by republicans and democrats alike the nation over all appointee of the supreme court have be choose solely on the basis of their character and their mental power not since the civil war have the member of that court divide on political line

 aside from the fact that the charge that the supreme court have be control by any political party be an atrocious one there be a deep implication in that statement do it disclose the democratic candidate 's conception of the function of the supreme court do he expect the supreme court to be subservient to he and his party do that statement express his intention by his appointment or otherwise to attempt to reduce that tribunal to an instrument of party policy and political action for sustain such doctrine as he may bring with he

 my countryman i repeat to you the fundamental issue of this campaign the decision that will fix the national direction for a hundred year to come be whether we shall go on in fidelity to american tradition or whether we shall turn to innovation the spirit of which be disclose to we by many sinister revelation and veiled promise

 my friend i wish to make my position clear i propose to go on in the faith and loyalty to the tradition of our race i propose to build upon the foundation which our father have lay over this last 150 year

in these closing hour of the campaign i be conscious that the american people be sum up in their mind the candidates&#39 statement the issue weigh the exposition of party policy make their appraisal of party measure and of man and thus prepare themselves individually for their final personal decision to be express by their ballot at the poll next tuesday
 i state a few day ago that the most important issue before the american people at this moment be to overcome this crisis what our people need be the restoration of their normal job and the recovery of agricultural price and of business they need help in the meantime to tide they over their difficulty in order that they may not suffer privation or lose their farm and home
 there be other measure which concern the more distant future we must not lose sight of they but the great balance in which to weigh the two great political party today be in their attitude toward this immediate problem because in this attitude lie their philosophy of government their ability to penetrate into cause their capacity to meet emergency and to translate measure into action and in these balance should also be weigh the question of honesty in presentation to the people of the fact so that they may formulate a proper judgment
 there be beyond this the common everyday fact as to whether the present administration measure and policy now in action be accomplish the purpose for which they be set out and therefore deserve ratification and retention by the people there be also reveal in this accomplishment what we may hope for in the way of performance for the future
 many of our hope for the long view development of our nation have be interrupt by the necessity to devote our concentrated attention to the protection of the american people from the cataclysm which have sweep over the world as the result of the aftermath of the world war
 our opponent have endeavor to build a fantastic fiction as to the cause of these event in the last 3 year in order that they might blame the republican party for all the distress and disaster which have happen not only in our country but in the rest of the world and thus resort to the old trick of politic by stimulate a protest vote that be play politic with human misery but in the pursuit of this misrepresentation they have demonstrate a total lack of understanding of the real situation with which the government must deal if we be ever to find our way out of this depression this narrowness of vision this incapacity to reach to the heart of thing be a complete demonstration of their unfitness for the still gigantic task of lead the nation back to normal life and the resumption of its forward march of progress they have deliberately avoid and decry the accumulation of strain which grow out of the great war they even ignore that such a war take place they ignore the piling up of our national debt and the debt among combatant nation great than the whole wealth of the united states
 they ignore the loss of the productive skill and intelligence of million in europe blot out by battle disease and starvation they ignore the poison spring of political instability which lie in the treaty that close the war the fear and hate that have hold armament to double those before that time they ignore the new nationalism of a score of small nation spring from the war with all their own tariff wall and disturbance to old channel of trade they ignore the ruinous government policy which fallaciously seek to build back to prosperity the impoverished country of europe by enlarged borrowing by subsidize industry and employment with taxis that sap the saving upon which industry must be rejuvenate and commerce solidly build under these strain the financial system of many foreign country crash one after another
 these blow strike at we through decrease world consumption of good
 if we look back over the distress of these year we find that three quarter of the population of the globe have suffer from the flame of revolution many nation be subject to constant change and vacillation other resort to dictatorship and tyranny in desperate attempt to maintain some sort of social order i ask you to compare that with the condition of the united states
 we be part of a world the disturbance of whose remotest population affect our own financial system our market our employment and the price of our farm product and we have many problem of our own grow out of the great war the inflation of value during the war and the stupendous increase of our debt the failure of foreign country to respond to their debt obligation to we finally with the desperate crisis abroad the whole world scramble to convert their property into gold and thus withdraw from we suddenly over $ 2,400 million of exchange and gold these fear spread to our own citizen cause they to withdraw $ 1,600 million in currency from circulation the effect of this be to withdraw vast sum of gold from our own use as we must protect the gold convertibility of our currency with further repercussion of credit stringency unemployment and drop price yet we have protect our dollar and make it re true on every counter in the world
 our own economist overlook one great fundamental factor that while our own people consume 90 percent of their production yet no one calculate the effect of worldwide fear upon our credit system and on the confidence of the nation which thereby suddenly undermine our industry and commerce
 in the face of these gigantic appal worldwide force our opponent set up the hawley smoot tariff bill change as it do the tariff on less than one sixth of our own import one one hundredth of the world&#39;s import and introduce long after the collapse start as the cause of all this world catastrophe what an unspeakable travesty upon reason this explanation be
 suppose that we have never have the hawley smoot tariff bill do you think for one moment that this crush collapse in the structure of the world these revolution these peril to civilization would not have happen and would not have reach into the united states
 and yet in order to make a political campaign by which they can play upon discontent so that they could hope to create a protest vote they be compel to set up this travesty of argument by this class appeal to the negative impulse of man they endeavor to lead they away from discussion of the actual measure which have be take to meet the actual fact of the world situation and to follow a mirage of miscellaneous vague hope they seek to lead they away from their realization that the restoration now begin should not be interrupt
 i would recall to you the unprecedented measure which we have introduce by which we have bring the full reserve power of the federal government into action to save community value and protect every family and fireside so far as it be humanly possible from deterioration
 we have prove time and again in our history in actual war the altruism and patriotism of our people the solidarity of their action toward a common objective but in this war against the invisible force we have see group of man attempt to profiteer from the misery of our people both to increase their own fortune and to increase their political strength we have see the very measure we have take for defense of our people and reconstruction of recovery subject to the cheap of political misrepresentation we have see attempt of these same group even in this national emergency to bring forth a philosophy of government which would destroy the whole american system on which we have build the great nation of a century and a half
 indeed this be the same philosophy of government which have poison all europe they have be the fume of the witch&#39; caldron which boil in russia and in its attenuate flavor spread over half of europe and would by many be introduce into the united states in an attempt to secure vote through protest of discontent against emergency condition we have have to meet such handicap from our opponent both while meet the first emergency which endanger the nation and in the building of employment and agriculture
 i have enumerate at various time in this campaign the measure adopt by the republican administration to meet this emergency i have enumerate on several occasion our long view policy to cement that recovery and to stimulate progress in our country for the future i will take your time for just a moment to refresh your mind on the unprecedented measure adopt from the beginning of this depression i will also refresh your mind on the measure lack of measure or destructive measure propose by our opponent
 1 the first of our measure which subsequently prove of great emergency service be the revision of the tariff by this act we give protection to our agriculture from a world demoralization which would have be infinitely bad than anything we have suffer and we prevent unemployment of million of workman
 2 we have secure extension of authority to the tariff commission by which the adjustment can be make to correct inequity in the tariff and to make change to meet economic tide and emergency thereby avoid the national disturbance of general revision of the tariff with all its greed and logrolling that authority become of vital importance today in the face of depreciate currency abroad
 3 at the outset of the depression we bring about an understanding between employer and employee that wage should be maintain they be maintain until the cost of living have decrease and the profit have practically vanish they be now the high real wage in the world
 with the concurrent agreement of labor leader at that time to minimize strike we have have a degree of social stability hitherto unknown in the history of any depression in our country we have not once in this depression have federal troop under arm to quell conflict which be the first time in 15 depression over a century i can not pay too high a tribute to the leader of labor leader of industry and our people in general for their intelligent self control and their devotion to the cause of order in time of stress
 last night one of the eminent orator of the democratic party begin his speech in new york by accuse the republican party of wage a campaign of fear declare that the success of the republican party at the poll next tuesday might be follow by mob disturbance to public order how do the gentleman explain the last 3 year of unparalleled social calm do he mean to charge that this magnificent body of self discipline citizen be suddenly overnight to become a mob or do he mean to imply that his party be the party of the mob in either event do he mean that we must accept the threat of mob rule in the united states as a guide to our conduct on election day thank god we still have some official in washington that can hold out against a mob
 4 an agreement to a spread of work where employer be compel to reduce production be bring about in order that none might be deprive of all their living and all might participate in the exist job and thus give real aid to million of family there can be no great service give by an industry to employee in these time
 5 we have mobilize throughout the country private charity and local and state support for the care of distress under which our woman and man have give such devoted service that the health of our country have actually improve
 6 by the expansion of state municipal and private construction work as an aid to employment and by the development of an enlarged program of federal construction which have be maintain at the rate of $ 600 million a year throughout the depression we have give support to hundred of thousand of family
 7 by the negotiation of the german moratorium and the standstill agreement upon external debt of that country we save their people from a collapse that would have set a prairie fire and possibly have involve the whole of our civilization
 8 we create the national credit association by cooperation of the banker of the country with a capital of $ 500 million which prevent the failure of a thousand bank with all the tragedy to their depositor and their borrower
 9 by drastic reduction in the ordinary operating expense of the federal government together with the increasing of the revenue in the year 1932 we contribute to balance the federal budget and thus hold impregnable the credit of the united states
 10 we create the reconstruction finance corporation originally with $ 2 billion of resource in order that having maintain national credit we should thrust the full resource of public credit behind private credit of the country and thus reestablish and maintain private enterprise in an unassailable position that with this backing of the federal credit act through exist institution we might protect depositor in saving bank insurance policyholder both lender and borrower in building and loan association through banking institution expand the fund available for loan to merchant manufacturer farmer and marketing association that we should protect the railway from receivership in order that in turn railway security in the great fiduciary institution such as our insurance company and saving bank might be protect and a score of million save from distress
 11 in addition to strengthen the capital of the federal land bank by $ 125 million we have through the reconstruction corporation make large loan to mortgage association for the same purpose and lately we have organize all lending agency into cooperative action to give the farmer who want to make a fight for his home a chance to hold it from foreclosure
 12 we extend authority under the federal reserve act to protect beyond all question the gold standard of the united states and at the same time expand the credit in counteraction to the strangulation due to hoarding and foreign withdrawal of gold
 13 we create the home loan discount bank with direct and indirect resource of several hundred million also act through exist institution in such fashion as to mobilize the resource of building and loan association and saving bank and other institution furnish to they cheap and long term capital to give to they the ability to save home from foreclosure to furnish credit to create new home and expand employment
 14 we secure further authority to the reconstruction corporation to assist in the early liquidation of deposit in close bank in order that we might relieve distress to million of depositor through democratic opposition we fail to secure authority from congress to carry this on a scale the country so sorely need today
 15 we secure increase authority to the reconstruction corporation to loan up to $ 300 million to the states whose resource have be exhaust to enable they to extend full relief to distress and to prevent any hunger and cold in the united states over this winter
 16 we increase the resource to the reconstruction corporation by a further $ 1,500 million for the undertaking of great public work which otherwise would have be delay await finance due to the stringency of credit these work be of a character which by their own earning will enable disposal of the repayment of these loan without charge upon the taxpayer
 17 we have erect a new system of agricultural credit bank with indirect resource of $ 300 million to reinforce the work of the intermediate credit bank and our other financing institution in the financing of production and livestock loan to farmer any farmer now with sound security may go to they for aid
 18 we have extend the authority to the reconstruction corporation to make loan for finance the normal movement of agricultural commodity to market both at home and abroad
 19 we have systematically mobilize banking and industry and business of the country with the cooperation of labor and agricultural leader to attack the depression on every front they have seek out and give assurance of credit to business and industry where employment would be increase and have cooperate in relief of agricultural mortgage pressure
 20 we have develop together with european nation a worldwide economic conference with view to relieve pressure upon we from foreign country to increase their stability to deal with the problem of silver and to prevent recurrence of these calamity if it can be humanly do
 21 we have give american leadership in development of drastic reduction of armament in order to reduce our own expenditure by $ 200 million a year and to increase the financial stability of foreign nation and above all to relieve the world of fear and political friction
 these be a part not all of the great and effective weapon with which we have fight the battle that have save the american people from disaster and chaos these weapon be still in action and advance along the whole front to the restoration of recovery
 i would call your attention to certain economic and social background of all these instrumentality that they be so construct as to act through exist agency to avoid competition of the government with private enterprise and responsibility their essence have be that of cooperation so create that with the passage of this emergency they can be withdraw leave our economic structure in its full strength and vitality they represent the full use of the federal power in time of emergency to protect the people that be the reason for the social calm in the united states as contrast with the riot in nearly every foreign country
 i recently enumerate at detroit some of the evidence of recuperation of the country under these measure in so short a period as 4 month since the destruction of public confidence by the democratic house of representatives cease
 i do not wish to weary you with statistic but to show the validity of that progress i may mention that in employment over a million man have now return to work during these 4 month this be the estimate of our government department the estimate of our employer place the number at a million and a half certainly we be now gain a half million a month
 last night i hear an evidence an evidence of recuperation that be go on the city of st. louis have make application for a large sum from the reconstruction corporation with which to carry their destitute over the winter i be inform yesterday that they ask that the application for that loan be cancel as it be no long require
 production of boot and shoe amount to 34 million pair in october the high output for any month in the year and high than the same month of the previous year
 hoard currency continue to return import of gold withdraw by frightened european holder have continue to increase deposit of bank continue to show steady expansion in 4 month they have increase by nearly a billion dollar this be money be put to work and an evidence of renew confidence
 a further indication of the upward movement of industry lie in the increase demand for electrical power which have increase by over 8 percent in the last 4 month every business index show some progress somewhere in the nation
 i do not want to say it in criticism for there be no one more devoted to our form of government than myself but there be one unfortunate incident in our system and that be that a change of party in power at the national election may come at a difficult moment a change at this election must mean 4 whole month in which there can be no definition of national policy during which time not only the commander of the force in battle for economic recovery must be change but the subordinate commander as well follow the period of delay and uncertainty the opposition party will as it have announce call a special session of congress in order to validate their promise and their new deal and whether these new policy be for well or bad at least a year must elapse before they can emerge into action the battle must stagnate at a time of its height and recovery must inevitably be delay
 and now in contrast with this constructive program of the republican party and this administration i wish to develop for you the democratic program to meet this depression as far as we have be able to find any definition to it i would again call your attention to the fact that with the democratic victory in congressional election of 1930 their leader promise to produce a program which would redeem this country from the depression no such program be produce until we be well into the winter of 1932 their program as develop under the leadership of mr. garner by the democratic house of representatives be
 1 they pass the collier bill provide for destruction of the tariff commission by reduce it again to a mere statistical body control by the congress have they succeed the relief which you so sorely require from competition with country of depreciate currency would today be impossible
 2 they attempt to instruct i by legislation to call an international conference through which the aid of foreign nation would be request to lower american tariff by which the independence of the united states in control of its domestic policy be to be place in the hand of an international body
 3 they pass an act instruct i to negotiate reciprocal the result of which could only be to deprive some locality of its protection for the benefit of another and by which the only sible agreement would involve the reduction of farm tariff in to build up market for other good i might far suggest that two large export commodity in the country be in the hand of a gentleman who will control the next congress
 4 they pass an omnibus pension bill with unworthy payment as an indication of their economical temper
 5 they pass an inadequate patchwork revenue bill the injustice of which to different industry and group must yet be remedie
 6 they pass indian claim bill to reopen settlement 75 year old in order to favor certain locality at the expense of the public treasury-
 7 they pass a bill instruct the federal reserve system and the treasury to fix price at average prevail during the year 1921 to 1929 by constantly shift the volume of currency and credit and thus creation of every uncertainty to business and industry by a rubber dollar this bill be stop but it have not be remove from their political calendar
 8 they defeat a large part of the national economy measure propose by the administration by their refusal to accept our recommendation by reduction of ordinary expenditure from $ 250 million to less than $ 50 million a part of which we subsequently rescue in the senate
 9 they pass the garner rainey pork barrel bill increase expenditure by $ 1,200 million for unnecessary nonproductive public work purely for the benefit of favor locality we stop this bill but it be still on their political calendar
 10 they pass the cash prepayment of the bonus call for immediate expenditure of $ 2,300 million and for actual increase in liability of the federal government over the original act by $ 1,300 million we stop this bill but it be still on their political calendar
 11 they pass the provision for the issuance of over $ 2,200 million of greenback currency a reversion to vicious practice already demonstrate in the last hundred year as the most destructive to labor agriculture and business we stop this bill and even as late as last night the democratic candidate fail to frankly disavow it
 12 they pass the rainey bill provide for direct personal banking for every conceivable purpose on every conceivable security to everyone who want money and thus the most destructive entry of the government into private business in a fashion that violate every principle of our nation i veto this bill but mr. garner still advocate it and it have not be remove from their political calendar
 13 they inject an expenditure of $ 322 million for entirely unnecessary purpose in time of great emergency the democratic candidate complain daily that we do not spend this money fast enough it be part of his economic program
 14 the congress pass proper authority to the executive for reorganization and elimination of useless government commission and bureau but by refuse my recommendation for immediate action they destroy its usefulness for a long time to come and probably destroy its consummation
 15 the democratic candidate eloquently urge the balancing of the budget but nowhere disavow these gigantic raid on the treasury under which no budget can ever be balance
 thus far i have recount to you the program of the democratic house under the leadership of mr. garner whose policy have receive commendation from the democratic convention which ratify they by nominate he vice president
 16 the democratic candidate add to this program the proposal to plant a billion tree and thereby immediately employ a million man but the secretary of agriculture have show that the tree available to plant will give they a total of less than 3 days&#39 work
 17 the democratic candidate promise to relieve agriculture with a 6 point program which amount to envisage to distressed farmer a great structure of agricultural relief but he have refuse to submit it to debate he have disclose no detail of the plan except six method by which he can escape from the promise
 18 the candidate have promise the immediate inauguration of a program of self liquidate public work such as utilization of our water resource flood control and land reclamation to provide employment for all surplus labor at all time that be contain in a letter address to all the unemployed in the united states which have have enormous circulation to employ the whole of the unemployed in the united states would exceed in cost $ 9 billion a year these work be unavailable if the work be there the cost would destroy the credit of the government deprive vast number of the man now work of their job and thus destroy the remedy itself this fantasy be a cruel promise to these suffer man and woman that they will be give job by the government which no government could fulfill
 19 the democratic party make its contribution to the emergency by propose to reduce the tariff to a competitive tariff for revenue their candidate state that he support this promise 100 percent a competitive tariff today would be ruinous to american agriculture and industry
 these be the only relief to this emergency that i can find in the whole democratic program they be mostly destructive i have give you some of the item of the republican program i submit to you this collection of 19 item which have be and be propose to the american people
 governor roosevelt in his address of last night state i have be scrupulously careful to make no idle promise to raise no false hope
 in st. louis last night i give a list of about a dozen unclarified promise some of which certainly raise high hope
 our opponent have devote themselves in the last few week to the idea that the republican party be endeavor to scare the american people i have never find they very easily scared and would not believe the american people could be the american people be not be disturb by my reassurance from the record that man be be restore to employment at the rate of 500,000 a month as the result of great program and policy inaugurate by this administration what be disturb the american people be the failure of the democratic candidate to show any satisfaction in this and his entire lack of assurance that these measure will be carry forward furthermore they find a total absence of constructive proposal from the democratic side for deal with this emergency they be confuse by indefinite promise as to the future they be dismay by the measure propose by the last democratic house of representatives which at no time have be disavow by the candidate and would destroy the very foundation of the republic they resent appeal to protest on the basis of personal misfortune the cause of which have be so brazenly misstate they be ask what the support of extreme radical mean to our american institution they wonder if the divergent part in the democratic party the sectional element and political element of which it consist do not spell a repetition of the quarrel and lack of confidence in their candidate so evident before their convention and thus an earnest of their own incapacity for united national action
 one issue of this campaign have become of more than normal importance and i wish to speak on that question that is the maintenance of our protective tariff these state be positively dependent upon the maintenance of protective tariff as a measure of recovery from this depression and the protective tariff be more in danger at this moment than at any time in recent history first because our opponent propose to reduce this tariff to the basis of competitive tariff for revenue which mean competition in the american market by the lower pay labor lower standard of living and the cheap land in any part of the world
 but beyond this the collapse of 30 nation unable to stand the accumulate strain grow out of the world war have bring about a depreciation of their currency all the way from 10 to 50 percent the result have be a further decrease in their wage their price and standard of living as compare to ours breach be be make daily in your farm tariff wall
 i wish to make a public survey into the actual purchasing power as a consequence of wage in a number of country to determine from their wage the amount of bread and butter which could be purchase at retail with a week&#39; wage i give out those figure 4 year ago and i give they out several day ago they show that in the united states nearly every group of labor can purchase somewhere between 900 and 1,000 pound of bread and butter from their weekly wage they show 4 year ago that our near competitor japan deliver good here could purchase there all the way from 600 to 750 they show several day ago that this nation could only buy 100 to 159 pound that be the difference in wage
 and in the face of this our democratic opponent propose to reduce our tariff they propose to do this in violation of their historic duty and in order to appeal to other section of the united states their candidate have refer to our tariff as exorbitant and a ghastly jest
 we must bear in mind that except wheat 99 percent of our agricultural product in this and neighboring state be consume within the border of the united states and the fate of american agriculture lie in hold the market within the boundary of the united states
 i could give you a few indication in actual effect of the present situation other than those i state at des moines indianapolis springfield i would point out that butter the indicator in dairy product sell in new york at 21 cent and yet except for the tariff wall it would be sell from new zealand and europe for 16 cent and i would point out another exhibit flax be 72 cent north of the canadian border and $ 1.08 south of that boundary owe to the protective tariff these price be depressingly low but they actually could be low if this tariff be take down some 4 million acre build up under the protective tariff must go into other product the competition of which will lower price in every other commodity another industry to which governor roosevelt have give especial attention be sugar as to which his promise would put another 750,000 acre into competition with other product
 one of the reason why agriculture have not make progress as rapidly in increase price in the last 4 month comparable with the increase employment of man be this increase competition from depreciated currency country this indeed give i the great concern fortunately the republican administration have be able to prevent the destruction of the flexible authority of the tariff commission through which alone these breach in the tariff wall might be repair
 the democratic candidate the democratic house of representatives and the democratic party in its platform promise consistently to destroy this authority of the tariff commission and i ask can you look to these man to repair these breach in the tariff wall when they propose to tear down the wall themselves
 in a speech last night the democratic candidate state that the tariff commission during 2 long year have investigate duty on only 73 commodity out of many thousand
 again he have be misinformed and be broadcast misinformation to the american people the tariff commission have consider over 250 item instead of the 73 he mention a great number of these item when they appear for consideration be find to have no basis for action they be withdraw by the applicant upon a showing of the fact but a great misrepresentation lie in the fact that except for the very large task that i have recently give the commission that be to reconsider the tariff as affect by depreciated currency owe to the collapse of foreign nation its docket be practically clear that mean that this tribunal which governor roosevelt say he will destroy have attend to practically every tariff application present by american citizen if there be a great number of item which need change be it not obvious that the need for this change would have be manifest because the enterprise american citizen would long since have bring it to this tribunal for immediate adjustment
 beyond the possibility of adjustment by the tariff commission we will widen the protective tariff by legislation if necessary to protect agriculture our oil and fat be suffer entirely unnecessarily from foreign import of these commodity the american market should be and must be reserve for the american farmer at all time whether emergency time or normal time
 governor roosevelt in his address last night also state i have be scrupulously careful to engage in no personality no unfair innuendo no baseless charge against the president of the united states
 i would like to have someone else answer this but it appear that i be the one to carry the answer across to the american people i would recommend that anyone interested in this statement should read governor roosevelt&#39;s speech from the beginning of this campaign
 i have be compel to take the unprecedented action of call attention to a few of they i have be also compel to frequently call attention to statement be put out through the democratic national committee and their agency which amount to positive calumny in no case have the democratic candidate disavow this action of his official committee or agency he have naturally profit by his silence
 i have be inform in this state that someone be endeavor to picture i as having vote in a foreign country as an indication that i be not a citizen of the united states i know it be direct from the activity of the democratic local committee but why answer those thing that picture be take from the tax roll of a foreign country where i at one time rent a house and where there be a tax on every item of rent and where the roll be make up from the tax roll where i never vote or have a right to vote this have be privately and publicly denounce by the secretary of state over the last 8 year
 i have just hear of another of these action which take place yesterday in the state of ohio the circulation of thousand of handbill state that the farm board spend $ 5 million annually in salary and have a fund of $ 250,000 for travel expense this statement be untrue there follow a long list of salary purport to be pay by the farm board
 it state incidentally that mr. roosevelt will abolish the farm board if that be true but i don&#39;t believe it be true that will be of interest to the 2 million member of farm cooperative in the united states and especially in a great part of the northwest
 as to the first point the administrative expenditure of the board be less than $ 900,000 per annum and i would call attention to the fact that the member of the farm board receive about $ 10,000 a year the salary refer to in this circular do not refer largely to the employee of the farm board many be exaggerated but the great bulk of they be official employ by farmer own farmer control and farmer manage cooperative because they have seek for the high skill in the marketing of their product the farm board have no control of these salary they be pay at the will of the american farmer and his organization the organization you have build up in this state and the salary be enumerate here as a matter of personal defamation of myself
 but the only point of importance for i to make now be that this be typical of story be spread through the nation with a view to mislead the people i regret that i have to refer to they they ought to be omit from a political discussion
 throughout the difficulty of the last 2 year there have stand out in high relief the courage and fortitude of the american people yet steadfast and brave as have be our man in the face of suffering and disaster our woman have be braver and more steadfast upon they the rigor of the world depression as do the rigor of the world war have bear most heavily untold anxiety self denial and drudgery have be their lot that their love one might be assure of that care in mind and body that would equip they to meet the problem of the future that the health of our people both infant and adult as evidence by vital statistic be now at its high point be a notable tribute to the love care and devotion of the woman of the united states today their heart be gladden by a well found hope of an early return to normal living condition in our country they must not be disappoint
 in the long dark day of recent month these woman bow with the burden of their own trouble have not be too preoccupied to send i many message of sympathy and encouragement unmove either by blind resentment or by cruel calumny they have do much to sustain my belief in the justice as well as the courage of my countryman whatever fortune may have in store for i during the remain year of my life my heart will ever be fill with gratitude to the woman of america for the understanding the faith and the cooperation which they have give i without stint during all of my year of public service
 and not only in the home of our country have woman borne their full share of the burden of the day more and more in the change condition of modern life woman have have to take their place side by side with man in factory in business in professional and in political life
 even before their enfranchisement president theodore roosevelt realize the need for woman in government when he appoint a woman to head his newly create children&#39;s bureau in the department of labor and that office have always be hold by a woman
 many woman be now hold post of grave responsibility in city and county and state and nation and their number will be greatly increase
 a step forward have be take in the last year the first woman to represent the government of the united states in a great international conference be miss mary e. woolley send by i as a member of the american delegation to the disarmament conference at geneva hers be a most distinguished service i have appoint an imposing list of woman to public duty and they have prove to have the high sense of service and the high kind of ability
 since the woman of america attain the vote they have naturally force certain question into wide attention of the nation education home protection and child welfare be as thoroughly bind up in the politic of the nation as any other issue as a result of the enfranchisement of woman
 i have observe in public discussion in this campaign that woman frequently take a long view of national life than do a great many man that be natural with woman they be intensely concerned with the policy which guarantee open equality of opportunity for the future of their boy and girl it be a comfort to find they familiar with the measure i have present to add to this security and they be also familiar with the lack of response with which the democratic house meet these measure
 i have long experience their courageous and tenacious ability in organization for public purpose
 during the food administration it be my pleasure to cooperate with the woman and it be my first opportunity to see the woman who organize a nation for save that our soldier and ally might be feed soon after it be with the woman that i organize the measure to save the life of 10 million european child soon after it be with the woman that i organize the better homes movement
 a few year ago when i begin to organize the white house conference on child health and protection i discover that the great majority fit for leadership in that work both by skill and experience be woman again when i organize the conference on home building and home ownership and it be necessary to create research committee to present conclusion to the conference i find the skill and spirit with which to carry on the special work largely among woman in order to get a proper perspective on the subject because they be the person in the community that have the experience to do it
 both these conference bring high result in the advancement of public thought they be already ring through our national life in concrete public action
 i have come to know the great ability of our womanhood for cooperative action they never cease nor become discouraged until success be attain
 of the great problem which demand safeguard probably none arise in high value than that of prevent war this be a primary necessity to the future of the nation we can not as a people run the risk of have our whole civilization degenerate and tear apart by such grim recurrence
 there be a fundamental source for prevention which have be too much overlook in this campaign no one can deny the fact that the depression would never have take place have it not be for the destructive force loosen by the great war if we be to ensure that our country shall not be rack and endanger by recurrence of such calamity the first measure for safety be that we should have peace in the world we have a vital part to play in the setup of machinery to replace war and force with the peaceful settlement of controversy between the nation we properly refuse to entangle ourselves in age old controversy in other part of the world our face be turn forward not backward we have take the position that we will not participate in try to compel people to engage in the settlement of controversy by the use of force
 the kellogg pact have be advance by this administration to a point now accept by the world as of far great potency than be even contemplate at the time of its inauguration under the policy we have advance we have definitely secure that the public opinion of the world will be mobilize and concentrate against those who violate that pact
 the whole history of this beautiful western country constitute a monument to the heroism of american woman and that pioneer spirit which bear so large a part in the development of the farm and fireside that now cover the western plain have come to its full expression during these later year in the assumption by woman of a full measure of political responsibility as american citizen my deep appreciation be give to the army of woman who have bear so valiant a part in this campaign their lofty conception of governmental affair and their keen understanding of political party and issue have give a new meaning to the history of american progress
 in these closing hour i be realize that i have be draw more deeply into this campaign than most president
 the emergency with which we have be deal during the past 30 year have call upon i for such continued and concentrated attention at the capital of the nation they have be so complicated and technical they have require such imperative and instant action that when this campaign begin i be force to the realization that few other responsible official of the government hold the full knowledge of all the ramification of a program which be not yet fully understand by the country i have feel that the president of the united states constantly review the history of our many struggle know the character of our people should never flinch in confidence in the future
 i deem it due to you and to the common cause we serve to bring to you the direct story of the endeavor that have be undertake for the common good in these past year in the past month i have receive many thousand of communication from our people i wish to express to you and to they the comfort i have have in the realization they have give to i that their concern have travel with mine as we have discuss together the grave issue of the period
 in the solemn sense that belong to last word of this campaign i assure you that i have endeavor in the presentation of these issue to appeal to the thoughtful people of the united states that i have keep foremost in my thought the welfare of my country that my vision have be of their home and their necessity and i accept this great demonstration as evidence of the support which you be give to i out of your conviction in this battle i have make no effort to appeal to destructive emotion i have make an endeavor to appeal to reason which i can only hope have be effective i have fix my faith upon the logical conclusion of the thoughtful people who have never fail this country in any hour of danger

 the measure and policy which have procure this turn toward recovery should be continue until the depression be pass and then the emergency agency should be promptly liquidate the expansion of credit facility by the federal reserve system and the reconstruction finance corporation have be of incalculable value the loan of the latter for reproductive work and to railway for the creation of employment its support of the credit structure through loan to bank insurance company railway building and loan association and to agriculture have protect the saving and insurance policy of million of our citizen and have relieve million of borrower from duress they have enable industry and business to function and expand the assistance give to farm loan banks the establishment of the home loan banks and agricultural credit associations all in their various ramification have place large sum of money at the disposal of the people in protection and aid beyond this the extensive organization of the country in voluntary action have produce profound result

 continue constructive policy promote the economic recovery of the country must be the paramount duty of the government the result of the agency we have create and the policy we have pursue have be to buttress our whole domestic financial structure and greatly to restore credit facility but progress in recovery require another element as well that be fully restore confidence in the future institution and man may have resource and credit but unless they have confidence progress be halt and insecure
 there be three definite direction in which action by the government at once can contribute to strengthen far the force of recovery by strengthen of confidence they be the necessary foundation to any other action and their accomplishment would at once promote employment and increase price
 the first of these direction of action be the continue reduction of all government expenditure whether national state or local the difficulty of the country demand undiminishe effort toward economy in government in every direction embrace in this problem be the unquestione balancing of the federal budget that be the first necessity of national stability and be the foundation of further recovery it must be balance in an absolutely safe and sure manner if full confidence be to be inspire
 the second direction for action be the complete reorganization at once of our banking system the shock to our economic life have undoubtedly be multiply by the weakness of this system and until they be remedied recovery will be greatly hamper
 the third direction for immediate action be vigorous and whole souled cooperation with other government in the economic field that our major difficulty find their origin in the economic weakness of foreign nation require no demonstration the first need to day be strengthen of commodity price that can not be permanently accomplish by artificiality it must be accomplish by expansion in consumption of good through the return of stability and confidence in the world at large and that in turn can not be fully accomplish without cooperation with other nation
 balance the budget
 i shall in due course present the executive budget to the congress it will show propose reduction in appropriation below those enact by the last session of the congress by over $ 830,000,000 in addition i shall present the necessary executive order under the recent act authorize the reorganization of the federal government which if permit to go into force will produce still further substantial economy these sum in reduction of appropriation will however be partially offset by an increase of about $ 250,000,000 in uncontrollable item such as increase debt service etc
 in the budget there be include only the completion of the federal public work project already undertake or under contract speed up of federal public work during the past four year as an aid to employment have advance many type of such improvement to the point where further expansion can not be justify in their usefulness to the government or the people as an aid to unemployment we should beyond the normal constructive program substitute reproductive or so call self liquidate work loan for such purpose have be provide for through the reconstruction finance corporation this change in character of project directly relieve the taxpayer and be capable of expansion into a large field than the direct federal work the reproductive work constitute an addition to national wealth and to future employment whereas further undue expansion of federal public work be but a burden upon the future
 the federal construction program thus limit to commitment and work in progress under the propose appropriation contemplate expenditure for the next fiscal year include naval and other vessel construction as well as other form of public work and maintenance of a total of $ 442,769,000 as compare with $ 717,262,000 for the present year
 the expenditure on such item over the four year end june 30 next will amount to $ 2,350,000,000 or an amount of construction work eight time as great as the cost of the panama canal and except for completion of certain long view project place the nation in many direction well ahead of its requirement for some year to come a normal program of about $ 200,000,000 per annum should hereafter provide for the country&#39; necessity and will permit substantial future reduction in federal expenditure
 i recommend that the furlough system instal last year be continue not only because of the economy produce but because be tantamount to the 5 day week it set an example which should be follow by the country and because it embrace within its working the spread work principle and thus serve to maintain a number of public servant who would otherwise be deprive of all income i feel however in view of the present economic situation and the decrease in the cost of live by over 20 per cent that some further sacrifice should be make by salaried official of the government over and above the 8 1/3 per cent reduction under the furlough system i will recommend that after exempt the first $ 1,000 of salary there should be a temporary reduction for one year of 11 per cent of that part of all government salary in excess of the $ 1,000 exemption the result of which combine with the furlough system will average about 14.8 per cent reduction in pay to those earn more than $ 1,000
 i will recommend measure to eliminate certain payment in the veterans&#39 service i conceive these outlay be entirely beyond the original intention of congress in build up veterans&#39 allowance many abuse have grow up from ill consider legislation they should be eliminate the nation should not ask for a reduction in allowance to man and dependent whose disability rise out of war service nor to those veteran with substantial service who have become totally disabled from non war connect cause and who be at the same time without other support these latter veteran be a charge on the community at some point and i feel that in view of their service to the nation as a whole the responsibility should fall upon the federal government
 many of the economy recommend in the budget be present at the last session of the congress but fail of adoption if the economy and appropriations committees of the congress in canvass these propose expenditure shall find further reduction which can be make without impair essential government service it will be welcome both by the country and by myself but under no circumstance do i feel that the congress should fail to uphold the total of reduction recommend
 some of the old revenue and some of the revenue provide under the act pass during the last session of the congress particularly those generally refer to as the nuisance taxis have not be as prolific of income as have be hope further revenue be necessary in addition to the amount of reduction in expenditure recommend many of the manufacturers&#39 excise taxis upon select industry not only fail to produce satisfactory revenue but they be in many way unjust and discriminatory the time have come when if the government be to have an adequate basis of revenue to assure a balanced budget this system of special manufacturers&#39 excise taxis should be extend to cover practically all manufacture at a uniform rate except necessary food and possibly some grade of clothing
 at the last session the congress respond to my request for authority to reorganize the government department the act provide for the grouping and consolidation of executive and administrative agency accord to major purpose and thereby reduce the number and overlap and duplication of effort executive order issue for these purpose be require to be transmit to the congress while in session and do not become effective until after the expiration of 60 calendar day after such transmission unless the congress shall soon approve
 i shall issue such executive order within a few day group or consolidate over fifty executive and administrative agency include a large number of commission and independent agency
 the second step of course remain that after these various bureaus and agency be place cheek by jowl into such group the administrative officer in charge of the group shall eliminate their overlap and still far consolidate these activity therein lie large economy
 the congress must be warn that a host of interested person inside and outside the government whose vision be concentrate on some particular function will at once protest against these proposal these same sort of activity have prevent reorganization of the government for over a quarter of a century they must be disregard if the task be to be accomplish
 banking
 the basis of every other and every further effort toward recovery be to reorganize at once our banking system the shock to our economic system have undoubtedly multiply by the weakness of our financial system i first call attention of the congress in 1929 to this condition and i have unceasingly recommend remedy since that time the subject have be exhaustively investigate both by the committee of the congress and the officer of the federal reserve system
 the banking and financial system be presume to serve in furnish the essential lubricant to the wheel of industry agriculture and commerce that is credit its diversion from proper use its improper use or its insufficiency instantly bring hardship and dislocation in economic life as a system our banking have fail to meet this great emergency it can be say without question of doubt that our loss and distress have be greatly augment by its wholly inadequate organization its inability as a system to respond to our need be to day a constant drain upon progress toward recovery in this statement i be not refer to individual bank or banker thousand of they have show distinguished courage and ability on the contrary i be refer to the system itself which be so organized or so lacking in organization that in an emergency its very mechanism jeopardize or paralyze the action of sound bank and its instability be responsible for periodic danger to our whole economic system
 bank failure rise in 1931 to 10 1/2 per cent of all the bank as compare to 1 1/2 per cent of the failure of all other type of enterprise since january 1 1930 we have have 4,665 bank suspend with $ 3,300,000,000 in deposit partly from fear and drain from abroad partly from these failure themselves which indeed often cause closing of sound bank we have witness hoarding of currency to an enormous sum rise during the height of the crisis to over $ 1,600,000,000 the result from interreaction of cause and effect have express themselves in strangulation of credit which at time have almost stifle the nation&#39;s business and agriculture the loss suffering and tragedy of our people be incalculable not alone do they lie in the loss of saving to million of home injury by deprival of work capital to thousand of small business but also in the frantic pressure to recall loan to meet pressure of hoarding and in liquidation of fail bank million of other people have suffer in the loss of their home and farm business have be ruin unemployment increase and farmers&#39 price diminish
 that this failure to function be unnecessary and be the fault of our particular system be plainly indicate by the fact that in great britain where the economic mechanism have suffer far great shock than our own there have not be a single bank failure during the depression again in canada where the situation have be in large degree identical with our own there have not be substantial bank failure
 the creation of the reconstruction finance corporation and the amendment to the federal reserve act serve to defend the nation in a great crisis they be not remedy they be relief it be inconceivable that the reconstruction corporation which have extend aid to nearly 6,000 institution and be manifestly but a temporary device can go on indefinitely
 it be to day a matter of satisfaction that the rate of bank failure of hoarding and the demand upon the reconstruction corporation have greatly lessen the acute phase of the crisis have obviously pass and the time have now come when this national danger and this failure to respond to national necessity must be end and the measure to end they can be safely undertake method of reform have be exhaustively examine there be no reason now why solution should not be find at the present session of the congress inflation of currency or governmental conduct of banking can have no part in these reform the government must abide within the field of constructive organization regulation and the enforcement of safe practice only
 parallel with reform in the banking law must be change in the federal farm loan banking system and in the joint stock land banks some of these change should be direct to permanent improvement and some to emergency aid to our people where they wish to fight to save their farm and home
 i wish again to emphasize this view that these widespread banking reform be a national necessity and be the first requisite for further recovery in agriculture and business they should have immediate consideration as step greatly need to further recovery
 economic cooperation with other nation
 our major difficulty during the past two year find their origin in the shock from economic collapse abroad which in turn be the aftermath of the great war if we be to secure rapid and assured recovery and protection for the future we must cooperate with foreign nation in many measure
 we have actively engage in a world disarmament conference where with success we should reduce our own tax burden and the tax burden of other major nation we should increase political stability of the world we should lessen the danger of war by increase defensive power and decrease offensive power of nation we would thus open new vista of economic expansion for the world
 we be participate in the formulation of a world economic conference successful result from which would contribute much to advance in agricultural price employment and business currency depreciation and correlate force have contribute greatly to decrease in price level moreover from these origin rise most of the destructive trade barrier now stifle the commerce of the world we could by successful action increase security and expand trade through stability in international exchange and monetary value by such action world confidence could be restore it would bring courage and stability which will reflect into every home in our land
 the european government obligate to we in war debt have request that there should be suspension of payment due the united states on december 15 next to be accompany by exchange of view upon this debt question our government have inform they that we do not approve of suspension of the december 15 payment i have state that i would recommend to the congress method to overcome temporary exchange difficulty in connection with this payment from nation where it may be necessary
 in the meantime i wish to reiterate that here be three great field of international action which must be consider not in part but as a whole they be of most vital interest to our people within they there be not only grave danger if we fail in right action but there also tie immense opportunity for good if we shall succeed within success there lie major remedy for our economic distress and major progress in stability and security to every fireside in our country
 the welfare of our people be dependent upon successful issue of the great cause of world peace world disarmament and organize world recovery nor be it too much to say that to day as never before the welfare of mankind and the preservation of civilization depend upon our solution of these question such solution can not be attain except by honest friendship by adherence to agreement enter upon until mutually revise and by cooperation amongst nation in a determination to find solution which will be mutually beneficial
 other legislation
 i have place various legislative need before the congress in previous message and these view require no amplification on this occasion i have urge the need for reform in our transportation and power regulation in the antitrust law as apply to our national resource industry western range conservation extension of federal aid to child health service membership in the world court the ratification of the great lakes st. lawrence seaway treaty revision of the bankruptcy act revision of federal court procedure and many other press problem
 these and other special subject i shall where necessary deal with by special communication to the congress
 the activity of our government be so great when combine with the emergency activity which have arise out of the world crisis that even the brief review of they would render the annual message unduly long i shall therefore avail myself of the fact that every detail of the government be cover in the report to the congress by each of the department and agency of the government
 conclusion
 it seem to i appropriate upon this occasion to make certain general observation upon the principle which must dominate the solution of problem now press upon the nation legislation in response to national need will be effective only if every such act conform to a complete philosophy of the people&#39; purpose and destiny ours be a distinctive government with a unique history and background consciously dedicated to specific ideal of liberty and to a faith in the inviolable sanctity of the individual human spirit furthermore the continued existence and adequate functioning of our government in preservation of order liberty and stimulation of progress depend upon the maintenance of state local institutional and individual sense of responsibility we have build a system of individualism peculiarly our own which must not be forget in any governmental act for from it have grow great accomplishment than those of any other nation
 on the social and economic side the background of our american system and the motivation of progress be essentially that we should allow free play of social and economic force as far as will not limit equality of opportunity and as will at the same time stimulate the initiative and enterprise of our people in the maintenance of this balance the federal government can permit of no privilege to any person or group it should act as a regulatory agent and not as a participant in economic and social life the moment the government participate it become a competitor with the people as a competitor it become at once a tyranny in whatever direction it may touch we have around we numerous such experience no one of which can be find to have justify itself except in case where the people as a whole have meet force beyond their control such as those of the great war and this great depression where the full power of the federal government must be exert to protect the people but even these must be limit to an emergency sense and must be promptly end when these danger be overcome
 with the free development of science and the consequent multitude of invention some of which be absolutely revolutionary in our national life the government must not only stimulate the social and economic responsibility of individual and private institution but it must also give leadership to cooperative action amongst the people which will soften the effect of these revolution and thus secure social transformation in an orderly manner the high form of self government be the voluntary cooperation within our people for such purpose
 but i would emphasize again that social and economic solution as such will not avail to satisfy the aspiration of the people unless they conform with the tradition of our race deeply groove in their sentiment through a century and a half of struggle for ideal of life that be root in religion and feed from purely spiritual spring

president hoover mr. chief justice my friend

 this be a day of national consecration and i be certain that on this day my fellow americans expect that on my induction into the presidency i will address they with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impel this be preeminently the time to speak the truth the whole truth frankly and boldly nor need we shrink from honestly face condition in our country today this great nation will endure as it have endure will revive and will prosper so first of all let i assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear be fear itself nameless unreasoning unjustified terror which paralyze need effort to convert retreat into advance in every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor have meet with that understanding and support of the people themselves which be essential to victory i be convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical day

 in such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulty they concern thank god only material thing value have shrink to fantastic level taxis have rise our ability to pay have fall government of all kind be face by serious curtailment of income the mean of exchange be freeze in the current of trade the withered leave of industrial enterprise lie on every side farmer find no market for their produce the saving of many year in thousand of family be go

 more important a host of unemployed citizen face the grim problem of existence and an equally great number toil with little return only a foolish optimist can deny the dark reality of the moment

 yet our distress come from no failure of substance we be stricken by no plague of locust compare with the peril which our forefather conquer because they believe and be not afraid we have still much to be thankful for nature still offer her bounty and human effort have multiply it plenty be at our doorstep but a generous use of it languish in the very sight of the supply primarily this be because ruler of the exchange of mankind 's good have fail through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence have admit their failure and have abdicate practice of the unscrupulous money changer stand indict in the court of public opinion reject by the heart and mind of man

 true they have try but their effort have be cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition face by failure of credit they have propose only the lending of more money strip of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership they have resort to exhortation plead tearfully for restore confidence they know only the rule of a generation of self seeker they have no vision and when there be no vision the people perish

 the money changer have flee from their high seat in the temple of our civilization we may now restore that temple to the ancient truth the measure of the restoration lie in the extent to which we apply social value more noble than mere monetary profit

 happiness lie not in the mere possession of money it lie in the joy of achievement in the thrill of creative effort the joy and moral stimulation of work no long must be forget in the mad chase of evanescent profit these dark day will be worth all they cost we if they teach we that our true destiny be not to be minister unto but to minister to ourselves and to our fellow man

 recognition of the falsity of material wealth as the standard of success go hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position be to be value only by the standard of pride of place and personal profit and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often have give to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing small wonder that confidence languishe for it thrive only on honesty on honor on the sacredness of obligation on faithful protection on unselfish performance without they it can not live restoration call however not for change in ethic alone this nation ask for action and action now

 our great primary task be to put people to work this be no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously it can be accomplish in part by direct recruiting by the government itself treat the task as we would treat the emergency of a war but at the same time through this employment accomplish greatly need project to stimulate and reorganize the use of our natural resource

 hand in hand with this we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial center and by engage on a national scale in a redistribution endeavor to provide a well use of the land for those well fit for the land the task can be help by definite effort to raise the value of agricultural product and with this the power to purchase the output of our city it can be help by prevent realistically the tragedy of the grow loss through foreclosure of our small home and our farm it can be help by insistence that the federal state and local government act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduce it can be help by the unifying of relief activity which today be often scatter uneconomical and unequal it can be help by national planning for and supervision of all form of transportation and of communication and other utility which have a definitely public character there be many way in which it can be help but it can never be help merely by talk about it we must act and act quickly

 finally in our progress toward a resumption of work we require two safeguard against a return of the evil of the old order there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credit and investment so that there will be an end to speculation with other people 's money and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency

 these be the line of attack i shall presently urge upon a new congress in special session detailed measure for their fulfillment and i shall seek the immediate assistance of the several states

 through this program of action we address ourselves to put our own national house in order and make income balance outgo our international trade relation though vastly important be in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy i favor as a practical policy the putting of first thing first i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment but the emergency at home can not wait on that accomplishment

 the basic thought that guide these specific mean of national recovery be not narrowly nationalistic it be the insistence as a first consideration upon the interdependence of the various element in and part of the united states a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer it be the way to recovery it be the immediate way it be the strong assurance that the recovery will endure

 in the field of world policy i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor the neighbor who resolutely respect himself and because he do so respect the right of other the neighbor who respect his obligation and respect the sanctity of his agreement in and with a world of neighbor

 if i read the temper of our people correctly we now realize as we have never realize before our interdependence on each other that we can not merely take but we must give as well that if we be to go forward we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline because without such discipline no progress be make no leadership become effective we be i know ready and willing to submit our life and property to such discipline because it make possible a leadership which aim at a large good this i propose to offer pledge that the large purpose will bind upon we all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoke only in time of armed strife

 with this pledge take i assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicate to a disciplined attack upon our common problem

 action in this image and to this end be feasible under the form of government which we have inherit from our ancestor our constitution be so simple and practical that it be possible always to meet extraordinary need by change in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form that be why our constitutional system have prove itself the most superbly endure political mechanism the modern world have produce it have meet every stress of vast expansion of territory of foreign war of bitter internal strife of world relation

 it be to be hope that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before we but it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure

 i be prepare under my constitutional duty to recommend the measure that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require these measure or such other measure as the congress may build out of its experience and wisdom i shall seek within my constitutional authority to bring to speedy adoption

 but in the event that the congress shall fail to take one of these two course and in the event that the national emergency be still critical i shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront i i shall ask the congress for the one remain instrument to meet the crisis broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency as great as the power that would be give to i if we be in fact invade by a foreign foe

 for the trust repose in i i will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time i can do no less

 we face the arduous day that lie before we in the warm courage of national unity with the clear consciousness of seek old and precious moral value with the clean satisfaction that come from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike we aim at the assurance of a rounded and permanent national life

 we do not distrust the future of essential democracy the people of the united states have not fail in their need they have register a mandate that they want direct vigorous action they have ask for discipline and direction under leadership they have make i the present instrument of their wish in the spirit of the gift i take it

 in this dedication of a nation we humbly ask the blessing of god may he protect each and every one of we may he guide i in the day to come

i want to talk for a few minute with the people of the united states about banking with the comparatively few who understand the mechanic of banking but more particularly with the overwhelming majority who use bank for the making of deposit and the drawing of check i want to tell you what have be do in the last few day why it be do and what the next step be go to be i recognize that the many proclamation from state capitols and from washington the legislation the treasury regulation etc couch for the most part in banking and legal term should be explain for the benefit of the average citizen i owe this in particular because of the fortitude and good temper with which everybody have accept the inconvenience and hardship of the banking holiday i know that when you understand what we in washington have be about i shall continue to have your cooperation as fully as i have have your sympathy and help during the past week
 first of all let i state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank the bank do not put the money into a safe deposit vault it invest your money in many different form of credit bond commercial paper mortgage and many other kind of loan in other word the bank put your money to work to keep the wheel of industry and of agriculture turn around a comparatively small part of the money you put into the bank be keep in currency an amount which in normal time be wholly sufficient to cover the cash need of the average citizen in other word the total amount of all the currency in the country be only a small fraction of the total deposit in all of the bank
 what then happen during the last few day of february and the first few day of march because of undermined confidence on the part of the public there be a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposit into currency or gold a rush so great that the sound bank could not get enough currency to meet the demand the reason for this be that on the spur of the moment it be of course impossible to sell perfectly sound asset of a bank and convert they into cash except at panic price far below their real value
 by the afternoon of march 3 scarcely a bank in the country be open to do business proclamation temporarily close they in whole or in part have be issue by the governors in almost all the state
 it be then that i issue the proclamation provide for the nation wide bank holiday and this be the first step in the government 's reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric the second step be the legislation promptly and patriotically pass by the congress confirm my proclamation and broaden my power so that it become possible in view of the requirement of time to entend sic the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually this law also give authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of our banking facility i want to tell our citizen in every part of the nation that the national congress republicans and democrats alike show by this action a devotion to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that it be difficult to match in our history
 the third stage have be the series of regulation permit the bank to continue their function to take care of the distribution of food and household necessity and the payment of payroll
 this bank holiday while result in many case in great inconvenience be afford we the opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation no sound bank be a dollar bad off than it be when it close its door last monday neither be any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for immediate opening the new law allow the twelve federal reserve bank to issue additional currency on good asset and thus the bank that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call the new currency be be send out by the bureau of engraving and printing in large volume to every part of the country it be sound currency because it be back by actual good asset
 a question you will ask be this why be all the bank not to be reopen at the same time the answer be simple your government do not intend that the history of the past few year shall be repeat we do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank failure
 as a result we start tomorrow monday with the opening of bank in the twelve federal reserve bank city those bank which on first examination by the treasury have already be find to be all right this will be follow on tuesday by the resumption of all their function by bank already find to be sound in city where there be recognize clearinghouse that mean about 250 city of the united states
 on wednesday and succeed day bank in small place all through the country will resume business subject of course to the government 's physical ability to complete its survey it be necessary that the reopening of bank be extend over a period in order to permit the bank to make application for necessary loan to obtain currency need to meet their requirement and to enable the government to make common sense checkup
 let i make it clear to you that if your bank do not open the first day you be by no mean justify in believe that it will not open a bank that open on one of the subsequent day be in exactly the same status as the bank that open tomorrow
 i know that many people be worry about state bank not member of the federal reserve system these bank can and will receive assistance from member bank and from the reconstruction finance corporation these state bank be follow the same course as the national bank except that they get their license to resume business from the state authority and these authority have be ask by the secretary of the treasury to permit their good bank to open up on the same schedule as the national bank i be confident that the state banking department will be as careful as the national government in the policy relate to the opening of bank and will follow the same broad policy
 it be possible that when the bank resume a very few people who have not recover from their fear may again begin withdrawal let i make it clear that the bank will take care of all need and it be my belief that hoarding during the past week have become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime it need no prophet to tell you that when the people find that they can get their money that they can get it when they want it for all legitimate purpose the phantom of fear will soon be lay people will again be glad to have their money where it will be safely take care of and where they can use it conveniently at any time i can assure you that it be safe to keep your money in a reopened bank than under the mattress
 the success of our whole great national program depend of course upon the cooperation of the public on its intelligent support and use of a reliable system
 remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation be that it make it possible for bank more readily to convert their asset into cash than be the case before more liberal provision have be make for bank to borrow on these asset at the reserve banks and more liberal provision have also be make for issue currency on the security of those good asset this currency be not fiat currency it be issue only on adequate security and every good bank have an abundance of such security
 one more point before i close there will be of course some bank unable to reopen without be reorganize the new law allow the government to assist in make these reorganization quickly and effectively and even allow the government to subscribe to at least a part of new capital which may be require
 i hope you can see from this elemental recital of what your government be do that there be nothing complex or radical in the process
 we have a bad banking situation some of our banker have show themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the people 's fund they have use the money entrust to they in speculation and unwise loan this be of course not true in the vast majority of our bank but it be true in enough of they to shock the people for a time into a sense of insecurity and to put they into a frame of mind where they do not differentiate but seem to assume that the act of a comparative few have taint they all it be the government 's job to straighten out this situation and do it as quickly as possible and the job be be perform
 i do not promise you that every bank will be reopen or that individual loss will not be suffer but there will be no loss that possibly could be avoid and there would have be more and great loss have we continue to drift i can even promise you salvation for some at least of the sorely press bank we shall be engage not merely in reopen sound bank but in the creation of sound bank through reorganization it have be wonderful to i to catch the note of confidence from all over the country i can never be sufficiently grateful to the people for the loyal support they have give i in their acceptance of the judgment that have dictate our course even though all of our process may not have seem clear to they
 after all there be an element in the readjustment of our financial system more important than currency more important than gold and that be the confidence of the people confidence and courage be the essential of success in carry out our plan you people must have faith you must not be stampede by rumor or guess let we unite in banish fear we have provide the machinery to restore our financial system it be up to you to support and make it work
 it be your problem no less than it be mine together we can not fail

on a sunday night a week after my inauguration i use the radio to tell you about the banking crisis and the measure we be take to meet it i think that in that way i make clear to the country various fact that might otherwise have be misunderstood and in general provide a means of understanding which do much to restore confidence
 tonight eight week later i come for the second time to give you my report in the same spirit and by the same mean to tell you about what we have be do and what we be plan to do
 two month ago we be face serious problem the country be die by inch it be die because trade and commerce have decline to dangerously low level price for basic commodity be such as to destroy the value of the asset of national institution such as bank saving bank insurance company and other these institution because of their great need be foreclose mortgage call loan refuse credit thus there be actually in process of destruction the property of million of people who have borrow money on that property in term of dollar which have have an entirely different value from the level of march 1933 that situation in that crisis do not call for any complicated consideration of economic panacea or fancy plan we be face by a condition and not a theory
 there be just two alternative the first be to allow the foreclosure to continue credit to be withhold and money to go into hiding and thus force liquidation and bankruptcy of bank railroad and insurance company and a recapitalizing of all business and all property on a low level this alternative mean a continuation of what be loosely call deflation the net result of which would have be extraordinary hardship on all property owner and incidentally extraordinary hardship on all person work for wage through an increase in unemployment and a further reduction of the wage scale
 it be easy to see that the result of this course would have not only economic effect of a very serious nature but social result that might bring incalculable harm even before i be inaugurate i come to the conclusion that such a policy be too much to ask the american people to bear it involve not only a further loss of home farm saving and wage but also a loss of spiritual value the loss of that sense of security for the present and the future so necessary to the peace and contentment of the individual and of his family when you destroy these thing you will find it difficult to establish confidence of any sort in the future it be clear that mere appeal from washington for confidence and the mere lending of more money to shaky institution could not stop this downward course a prompt program apply as quickly as possible seem to i not only justified but imperative to our national security the congress and when i say congress i mean the member of both political party fully understand this and give i generous and intelligent support the member of congress realize that the method of normal time have to be replace in the emergency by measure which be suit to the serious and press requirement of the moment there be no actual surrender of power congress still retain its constitutional authority and no one have the slight desire to change the balance of these power the function of congress be to decide what have to be do and to select the appropriate agency to carry out its will this policy it have strictly adhere to the only thing that have be happen have be to designate the president as the agency to carry out certain of the purpose of the congress this be constitutional and in keep with the past american tradition
 the legislation which have be pass or in the process of enactment can properly be consider as part of a well ground plan
 first we be give opportunity of employment to one quarter of a million of the unemployed especially the young man who have dependent to go into the forestry and flood prevention work this be a big task because it mean feeding clothing and care for nearly twice as many man as we have in the regular army itself in create this civilian conservation corp we be kill two bird with one stone we be clearly enhance the value of our natural resource and second we be relieve an appreciable amount of actual distress this great group of man have enter upon their work on a purely voluntary basis no military training be involve and we be conserve not only our natural resource but our human resource one of the great value to this work be the fact that it be direct and require the intervention of very little machinery
 second i have request the congress and have secure action upon a proposal to put the great property own by our government at muscle shoals to work after long year of wasteful inaction and with this a broad plan for the improvement of a vast area in the tennessee valley it will add to the comfort and happiness of hundred of thousand of people and the incident benefit will reach the entire nation
 next the congress be about to pass legislation that will greatly ease the mortgage distress among the farmer and the home owner of the nation by provide for the easing of the burden of debt now bear so heavily upon million of our people our next step in seek immediate relief be a grant of half a billion dollar to help the state county and municipality in their duty to care for those who need direct and immediate relief the congress also pass legislation authorize the sale of beer in such state as desire this have already result in considerable reemployment and incidentally have provide much need tax revenue
 we be plan to ask the congress for legislation to enable the government to undertake public work thus stimulate directly and indirectly the employment of many other in well consider project
 further legislation have be take up which go much more fundamentally into our economic problem the farm relief bill seek by the use of several method alone or together to bring about an increase return to farmer for their major farm product seek at the same time to prevent in the day to come disastrous over production which so often in the past have keep farm commodity price far below a reasonable return this measure provide wide power for emergency the extent of its use will depend entirely upon what the future have in store
 well consider and conservative measure will likewise be propose which will attempt to give to the industrial worker of the country a more fair wage return prevent cut throat competition and unduly long hour for labor and at the same time to encourage each industry to prevent over production
 our railroad bill fall into the same class because it seek to provide and make certain definite planning by the railroad themselves with the assistance of the government to eliminate the duplication and waste that be now result in railroad receivership and continue operating deficit
 i be certain that the people of this country understand and approve the broad purpose behind these new governmental policy relate to agriculture and industry and transportation we find ourselves face with more agricultural product than we could possibly consume ourselves and surplus which other nation do not have the cash to buy from we except at price ruinously low we have find our factory able to turn out more good than we could possibly consume and at the same time we be face with a fall export demand we find ourselves with more facility to transport good and crop than there be good and crop to be transport all of this have be cause in large part by a complete lack of planning and a complete failure to understand the danger signal that have be fly ever since the close of the world war the people of this country have be erroneously encourage to believe that they could keep on increase the output of farm and factory indefinitely and that some magician would find way and mean for that increase output to be consume with reasonable profit to the producer
 today we have reason to believe that thing be a little well than they be two month ago industry have pick up railroad be carry more freight farm price be well but i be not go to indulge in issue proclamation of over enthusiastic assurance we can not bally ho ourselves back to prosperity i be go to be honest at all time with the people of the country i do not want the people of this country to take the foolish course of let this improvement come back on another speculative wave i do not want the people to believe that because of unjustified optimism we can resume the ruinous practice of increase our crop output and our factory output in the hope that a kind providence will find buyer at high price such a course may bring we immediate and false prosperity but it will be the kind of prosperity that will lead we into another tailspin
 it be wholly wrong to call the measure that we have take government control of farming control of industry and control of transportation it be rather a partnership between government and farming and industry and transportation not partnership in profit for the profit would still go to the citizen but rather a partnership in planning and partnership to see that the plan be carry out
 let i illustrate with an example take the cotton good industry it be probably true that ninety per cent of the cotton manufacturer would agree to eliminate starvation wage would agree to stop long hour of employment would agree to stop child labor would agree to prevent an overproduction that would result in unsalable surplus but what good be such an agreement if the other ten per cent of cotton manufacturer pay starvation wage require long hour employ child in their mill and turn out burdensome surplus the unfair ten per cent could produce good so cheaply that the fair ninety per cent would be compel to meet the unfair condition here be where government come in government ought to have the right and will have the right after surveying and planning for an industry to prevent with the assistance of the overwhelming majority of that industry unfair practice and to enforce this agreement by the authority of government the so call anti trust law be intend to prevent the creation of monopoly and to forbid unreasonable profit to those monopoly that purpose of the anti trust law must be continue but these law be never intend to encourage the kind of unfair competition that result in long hour starvation wage and overproduction
 the same principle apply to farm product and to transportation and every other field of organized private industry
 we be work toward a definite goal which be to prevent the return of condition which come very close to destroy what we call modern civilization the actual accomplishment of our purpose can not be attain in a day our policy be wholly within purpose for which our american constitutional government be establish 150 year ago
 i know that the people of this country will understand this and will also understand the spirit in which we be undertake this policy i do not deny that we may make mistake of procedure as we carry out the policy i have no expectation of make a hit every time i come to bat what i seek be the high possible batting average not only for myself but for the team theodore roosevelt once say to i if i can be right 75 percent of the time i shall come up to the full measure of my hope
 much have be say of late about federal finance and inflation the gold standard etc let i make the fact very simple and my policy very clear in the first place government credit and government currency be really one and the same thing behind government bond there be only a promise to pay behind government currency we have in addition to the promise to pay a reserve of gold and a small reserve of silver in this connection it be worth while remember that in the past the government have agree to redeem nearly thirty billion of its debt and its currency in gold and private corporation in this country have agree to redeem another sixty or seventy billion of security and mortgage in gold the government and private corporation be make these agreement when they know full well that all of the gold in the united states amount to only between three and four billion and that all of the gold in all of the world amount to only about eleven billion
 if the holder of these promise to pay start in to demand gold the first comer would get gold for a few day and they would amount to about one twenty fifth of the holder of the security and the currency the other twenty four people out of twenty five who do not happen to be at the top of the line would be tell politely that there be no more gold leave we have decide to treat all twenty five in the same way in the interest of justice and the exercise of the constitutional power of this government we have place every one on the same basis in order that the general good may be preserve
 nevertheless gold and to a partial extent silver be perfectly good basis for currency and that be why i decide not to let any of the gold now in the country go out of it
 a series of condition arise three week ago which very readily might have mean first a drain on our gold by foreign country and secondly as a result of that a flight of american capital in the form of gold out of our country it be not exaggerate the possibility to tell you that such an occurrence might well have take from we the major part of our gold reserve and result in such a further weakening of our government and private credit as to bring on actual panic condition and the complete stoppage of the wheel of industry
 the administration have the definite objective of raise commodity price to such an extent that those who have borrow money will on the average be able to repay that money in the same kind of dollar which they borrow we do not seek to let they get such a cheap dollar that they will be able to pay bock a great deal less than they borrow in other word we seek to correct a wrong and not to create another wrong in the opposite direction that be why power be be give to the administration to provide if necessary for an enlargement of credit in order to correct the exist wrong these power will be use when as and if it may be necessary to accomplish the purpose
 hand in hand with the domestic situation which of course be our first concern be the world situation and i want to emphasize to you that the domestic situation be inevitably and deeply tie in with the condition in all of the other nation of the world in other word we can get in all probability a fair measure of prosperity return in the united states but it will not be permanent unless we get a return to prosperity all over the world
 in the conference which we have hold and be hold with the leader of other nation we be seek four great objective first a general reduction of armament and through this the removal of the fear of invasion and armed attack and at the same time a reduction in armament cost in order to help in the balancing of government budget and the reduction of taxation secondly a cutting down of the trade barrier in order to re start the flow of exchange of crop and good between nation third the setting up of a stabilization of currency in order that trade can make contract ahead fourth the reestablishment of friendly relation and great confidence between all nation
 our foreign visitor these past three week have respond to these purpose in a very helpful way all of the nations have suffer alike in this great depression they have all reach the conclusion that each can well be help by the common action of all it be in this spirit that our visitor have meet with we and discuss our common problem the international conference that lie before we must succeed the future of the world demand it and we have each of we pledge ourselves to the good joint effort to this end
 to you the people of this country all of we the members of the congress and the member of this administration owe a profound debt of gratitude throughout the depression you have be patient you have grant we wide power you have encourage we with a wide spread approval of our purpose every ounce of strength and every resource at our command we have devote to the end of justify your confidence we be encourage to believe that a wise and sensible beginning have be make in the present spirit of mutual confidence and mutual encouragement we go forward

after the adjournment of the historical special session of the congress five week ago i purposely refrain from address you for two very good reason

 first i think that we all want the opportunity of a little quiet thought to examine and assimilate in a mental picture the crowd event of the hundred day which have be devote to the starting of the wheel of the new deal

 secondly i want a few week in which to set up the new administrative organization and to see the first fruit of our careful planning

 i think it will interest you if i set forth the fundamental of this planning for national recovery and this i be very certain will make it abundantly clear to you that all of the proposal and all of the legislation since the fourth day of march have not be just a collection of haphazard scheme but rather the orderly component part of a connected and logical whole

 long before inauguration day i become convinced that individual effort and local effort and even disjoint federal effort have fail and of necessity would fail and therefore that a rounded leadership by the federal government have become a necessity both of theory and of fact such leadership however have its beginning in preserve and strengthen the credit of the united states government because without that no leadership be a possibility for year the government have not live within its income the immediate task be to bring our regular expense within our revenue that have be do

 it may seem inconsistent for a government to cut down its regular expense and at the same time to borrow and to spend billion for an emergency but it be not inconsistent because a large portion of the emergency money have be pay out in the form of sound loan which will be repay to the treasury over a period of year and to cover the rest of the emergency money we have impose taxis to pay the interest and the installment on that part of the debt

 so you will see that we have keep our credit good we have build a granite foundation in a period of confusion that foundation of the federal credit stand there broad and sure it be the base of the whole recovery plan

 then come the part of the problem that concern the credit of the individual citizen themselves you and i know of the banking crisis and of the great danger to the saving of our people on march sixth every national bank be close one month later 90 per cent of the deposit in the national bank have be make available to the depositor today only about 5 per cent of the deposit in national bank be still tie up the condition relate to state bank while not quite so good on a percentage basis be shove a steady reduction in the total of frozen deposit a result much well than we have expect three month ago

 the problem of the credit of the individual be make more difficult because of another fact the dollar be a different dollar from the one with which the average debt have be incur for this reason large number of people be actually lose possession of and title to their farm and home all of you know the financial step which have be take to correct this inequality in addition the home loan act the farm loan act and the bankruptcy act be pass

 it be a vital necessity to restore purchasing power by reduce the debt and interest charge upon our people but while we be help people to save their credit it be at the same time absolutely essential to do something about the physical need of hundred of thousand who be in dire strait at that very moment municipal and state aid be be stretch to the limit we appropriate half a billion dollar to supplement their effort and in addition as you know we have put 300,000 young man into practical and useful work in our forest and to prevent flood and soil erosion the wage they earn be go in great part to the support of the nearly one million people who constitute their family

 in this same classification we can properly place the great public work program run to a total of over three billion dollars to be use for highway and ship and flood prevention and inland navigation and thousand of self sustain state and municipal improvement two point should be make clear in the allotting and administration of these project first we be use the utmost care to choose labor create quick act useful project avoid the smell of the pork barrel and secondly we be hope that at least half of the money will come back to the government from project which will pay for themselves over a period of year

 thus far i have speak primarily of the foundation stone the measure that be necessary to re establish credit and to head people in the opposite direction by prevent distress and provide as much work as possible through governmental agency now i come to the link which will build we a more lasting prosperity i have say that we can not attain that in a nation half boom and half break if all of our people have work and fair wage and fair profit they can buy the product of their neighbor and business be good but if you take away the wage and the profit of half of they business be only half as good it doesn&#39;t help much if the fortunate half be very prosperous the good way be for everybody to be reasonably prosperous

 for many year the two great barrier to a normal prosperity have be low farm price and the creep paralysis of unemployment these factor have cut the purchase power of the country in half i promise action congress do its part when it pass the farm and the industrial recovery act today we be put these two act to work and they will work if people understand their plain objective

 first the farm act it be base on the fact that the purchase power of nearly half our population depend on adequate price for farm product we have be produce more of some crop than we consume or can sell in a depressed world market the cure be not to produce so much without our help the farmer can not get together and cut production and the farm bill give they a method of bring their production down to a reasonable level and of obtain reasonable price for their crop i have clearly state that this method be in a sense experimental but so far as we have go we have reason to believe that it will produce good result

 it be obvious that if we can greatly increase the purchase power of the ten of million of our people who make a living from farming and the distribution of farm crop we will greatly increase the consumption of those good which be turn out by industry

 that bring i to the final step bring back industry along sound line

 last autumn on several occasion i express my faith that we can make possible by democratic self discipline in industry general increase in wage and shortening of hour sufficient to enable industry to pay its own worker enough to let those worker buy and use the thing that their labor produce this can be do only if we permit and encourage cooperative action in industry because it be obvious that without united action a few selfish man in each competitive group will pay starvation wage and insist on long hour of work other in that group must either follow suit or close up shop we have see the result of action of that kind in the continue descent into the economic hell of the past four year

 there be a clear way to reverse that process if all employer in each competitive group agree to pay their worker the same wage reasonable wage and require the same hour reasonable hour then high wage and short hour will hurt no employer moreover such action be well for the employer than unemployment and low wage because it make more buyer for his product that be the simple idea which be the very heart of the industrial recovery act

 on the basis of this simple principle of everybody do thing together we be start out on this nationwide attack on unemployment it will succeed if our people understand it in the big industry in the little shop in the great city and in the small village there be nothing complicated about it and there be nothing particularly new in the principle it go back to the basic idea of society and of the nation itself that people act in a group can accomplish thing which no individual act alone could even hope to bring about

 here be an example in the cotton textile code and in other agreement already sign child labor have be abolish that make i personally happy than any other one thing with which i have be connect since i come to washington in the textile industry an industry which come to i spontaneously and with a splendid cooperation as soon as the recovery act be sign child labor be an old evil but no employer act alone be able to wipe it out if one employer try it or if one state try it the cost of operation rise so high that it be impossible to compete with the employer or state which have fail to act the moment the recovery act be pass this monstrous thing which neither opinion nor law could reach through year of effort go out in a flash as a british editorial put it we do more under a code in one day than they in england have be able to do under the common law in eighty five year of effort i use this incident my friend not to boast of what have already be do but to point the way to you for even great cooperative effort this summer and autumn

 we be not go through another winter like the last i doubt if ever any people so bravely and cheerfully endure a season half so bitter we can not ask america to continue to face such needless hardship it be time for courageous action and the recovery bill give we the mean to conquer unemployment with exactly the same weapon that we have use to strike down child labor

 the proposition be simply this

 if all employer will act together to shorten hour and raise wage we can put people back to work no employer will suffer because the relative level of competitive cost will advance by the same amount for all but if any considerable group should lag or shirk this great opportunity will pass we by and we will go into another desperate winter this must not happen

 we have send out to all employer an agreement which be the result of week of consultation this agreement check against the voluntary code of nearly all the large industry which have already be submit this blanket agreement carry the unanimous approval of the three board which i have appoint to advise in this board represent the great leader in labor in industry and in social service the agreement have already bring a flood of approval from every state and from so wide a cross section of the common calling of industry that i know it be fair for all it be a plan --deliberate reasonable and just intend to put into effect at once the most important of the broad principle which be be establish industry by industry through code naturally it take a good deal of organizing and a great many hearing and many month to get these code perfect and sign and we can not wait for all of they to go through the blanket agreement however which i be send to every employer will start the wheel turn now and not six month from now

 there be of course man a few of they who might thwart this great common purpose by seek selfish advantage there be adequate penalty in the law but i be now ask the cooperation that come from opinion and from conscience these be the only instrument we shall use in this great summer offensive against unemployment but we shall use they to the limit to protect the willing from the laggard and to make the plan succeed

 in war in the gloom of night attack soldier wear a bright badge on their shoulder to be sure that comrade do not fire on comrade on that principle those who cooperate in this program must know each other at a glance that be why we have provide a badge of honor for this purpose a simple design with a legend we do our part and i ask that all those who join with i shall display that badge prominently it be essential to our purpose

 already all the great basic industry have come forward willingly with propose code and in these code they accept the principle lead to mass reemployment but important as be this hearten demonstration the rich field for result be among the small employer those whose contribution will give new work for from one to ten people these small employer be indeed a vital part of the backbone of the country and the success of our plan lie largely in their hand

 already the telegram and letter be pour into the white house --messages from employer who ask that their name be place on this special roll of honor they represent great corporation and company and partnership and individual i ask that even before the date set in the agreement which we have send out the employer of the country who have not already do so the big fellow and the little fellow shall at once write or telegraph to i personally at the white house express their intention of go through with the plan and it be my purpose to keep post in the post office of every town a roll of honor of all those who join with i

 i want to take this occasion to say to the twenty four governor who be now in conference in san francisco that nothing thus far have help in strengthen this great movement more than their resolution adopt at the very outset of their meeting give this plan their instant and unanimous approval and pledge to support it in their state

 to the man and woman whose life have be darken by the fact or the fear of unemployment i be justify in say a word of encouragement because the code and the agreement already approve or about to be pass upon prove that the plan do raise wage and that it do put people back to work you can look on every employer who adopt the plan as one who be do his part and those employer deserve well of everyone who work for a living it will be clear to you as it be to i that while the shirk employer may undersell his competitor the saving he thus make be make at the expense of his country&#39; welfare

 while we be make this great common effort there should be no discord and dispute this be no time to cavil or to question the standard set by this universal agreement it be time for patience and understanding and cooperation the worker of this country have right under this law which can not be take from they and nobody will be permit to whittle they away but on the other hand no aggression be now necessary to attain those right the whole country will be unite to get they for you the principle that apply to the employer apply to the worker as well and i ask you worker to cooperate in the same spirit

 when andrew jackson old hickory die someone ask will he go to heaven and the answer be he will if he want to if i be ask whether the american people will pull themselves out of this depression i answer they will if they want to the essence of the plan be a universal limitation of hour of work per week for any individual by common consent and a universal payment of wage above a minimum also by common consent i can not guarantee the success of this nationwide plan but the people of this country can guarantee its success i have no faith in cure all but i believe that we can greatly influence economic force i have no sympathy with the professional economist who insist that thing must run their course and that human agency can have no influence on economic ill one reason be that i happen to know that professional economist have change their definition of economic law every five or ten year for a very long time but i do have faith and retain faith in the strength of common purpose and in the strength of unified action take by the american people

 that be why i be describe to you the simple purpose and the solid foundation upon which our program of recovery be build that be why i be ask the employer of the nation to sign this common covenant with i to sign it in the name of patriotism and humanity that be why i be ask the worker to go along with we in a spirit of understanding and of helpfulness
it be three month since i have talk with the people of this country about our national problem but during this period many thing have happen and i be glad to say that the major part of they have greatly help the well being of the average citizen

 because in every step which your government be take we be think in term of the average of you in the old word the great good to the great number we as reasonable people can not expect to bring definite benefit to every person or to every occupation or business or industry or agriculture in the same way no reasonable person can expect that in this short space of time during which new machinery have to be not only put to work but first set up that every locality in every one of the 48 state of the country could share equally and simultaneously in the trend to well time

 the whole picture however the average of the whole territory from coast to coast the average of the whole population of 120,000,000 people show to any person willing to look fact and action of which you and i can be proud

 in the early spring of this year there be actually and proportionately more people out of work in this country than in any other nation in the world fair estimate show 12 or 13 million unemployed last march among those there be of course several million who could be class as normally unemployed people who work occasionally when they feel like it and other who prefer not to work at all it seem therefore fair to say that there be about 10 million of our citizen who earnestly and in many case hungrily be seek work and could not get it of these in the short space of a few month i be convinced that at least 4 million have be give employment or say it another way 40 percent of those seek work have find it

 that do not mean my friend that i be satisfied or that you be satisfied that our work be end we have a long way to go but we be on the way

 how be we construct the edifice of recovery the temple which when complete will no long be a temple of money changer or of beggar but rather a temple dedicate to and maintain for a great social justice a great welfare for america the habitation of a sound economic life we be build stone by stone the column which will support that habitation those column be many in number and though for a moment the progress of one column may disturb the progress on the pillar next to it the work on all of they must proceed without let or hindrance

 we all know that immediate relief for the unemployed be the first essential of such a structure and that be why i speak first of the fact that three hundred thousand young man have be give employment and be be give employment all through this winter in the civilian conservation corps camps in almost every part of the nation

 so too we have as you know expend great sum in cooperation with state and locality for work relief and home relief than ever before sum which during the come winter can not be lessen for the very simple reason that though several million people have go back to work the necessity of those who have not yet obtain work be more severe than at this time last year

 then we come to the relief that be be give to those who be in danger of lose their farm or their home new machinery have to be set up for farm credit and for home credit in every one of the thirty one hundred county of the united states and every day that pass be save home and farm to hundred of family i have publicly ask that foreclosure on farm and chattel and on home be delay until every mortgagor in the country shall have have full opportunity to take advantage of federal credit i make the further request which many of you know have already be make through the great federal credit organization that if there be any family in the united states about to lose its home or about to lose its chattel that family should telegraph at once either to the farm credit administration or the home owners loan corporation in washington request their help

 two other great agency be in full swing the reconstruction finance corporation continue to lend large sum to industry and finance with the definite objective of make easy the extending of credit to industry commerce and finance

 the program of public work in three month have advance to this point out of a total appropriate for public work of three billion three hundred million one billion eight hundred million have already be allocate to federal project of all kind and literally in every part of the united states and work on these be start forward in addition three hundred million have be allocate to public work to be carry out by state municipality and private organization such as those undertaking slum clearance the balance of the public work money nearly all of it intend for state or local project wait only on the presentation of proper project by the state and locality themselves washington have the money and be wait for the proper project to which to allot it

 another pillar in the making be the agricultural adjustment administration i have be amazed by the extraordinary degree of cooperation give to the government by the cotton farmer in the south the wheat farmer of the west the tobacco farmer of the southeast and i be confident that the corn hog farmer of the middle west will come through in the same magnificent fashion the problem we seek to solve have be steadily get bad for twenty year but during the last six month we have make more rapid progress than any nation have ever make in a like period of time it be true that in july farm commodity price have be push up high than they be today but that push come in part from pure speculation by people who could not tell you the difference between wheat and rye by people who have never see cotton grow by people who do not know that hog be feed on corn people who have no real interest in the farmer and his problem

 in spite however of the speculative reaction from the speculative advance it seem to be well establish that during the course of the year 1933 the farmer of the united states will receive 33 percent more dollar for what they have produce than they receive in the year 1932 put in another way they will receive $ 400 in 1933 where they receive $ 300 the year before that remember be for the average of the country for i have report that some section be not any well off than they be a year ago this apply among the major product especially to cattle raise and the dairy industry we be go after those problem as fast as we can

 i do not hesitate to say in the simple clear language of which i be capable that although the price of many product of the farm have go up and although many farm family be well off than they be last year i be not satisfied either with the amount or the extent of the rise and that it be definitely a part of our policy to increase the rise and to extend it to those product which have as yet feel no benefit if we can not do this one way we will do it another do it we will

 stand beside the pillar of the farm the a.a.a. be the pillar of industry --the n.r.a. its object be to put industry and business worker into employment and to increase their purchasing power through increase wage

 it have abolish child labor it have eliminate the sweat shop it have end sixty cent a week pay in some mill and eighty cent a week pay in some mine the measure of the growth of this pillar lie in the total figure of reemployment which i have already give you and in the fact that reemployment be continue and not stop the secret of n.r.a. be cooperation that cooperation have be voluntarily give through the signing of the blanket code and through the signing of specific code which already include all of the great industry of the nation

 in the vast majority of case in the vast majority of locality the n.r.a. have be give support in unstinted measure we know that there be chiseler at the bottom of every case of criticism and obstruction we have find some selfish interest some private axe to grind

 ninety percent of complaint come from misconception for example it have be say that n.r.a. have fail to raise the price of wheat and corn and hog that n.r.a. have not loan enough money for local public work of course n.r.a. have nothing whatsoever to do with the price of farm product nor with public work it have to do only with industrial organization for economic planning to wipe out unfair practice and to create reemployment even in the field of business and industry n. r. a. do not apply to the rural community or to town of under twenty five hundred population except in so far as those town contain factory or chain store which come under a specific code

 it be also true that among the chiseler to whom i have refer there be not only the big chiseler but also petty chiseler who seek to make undue profit on untrue statement let i cite to you the example of the salesman in a store in a large eastern city who try to justify the increase in the price of a cotton shirt from one dollar and a half to two dollar and a half by say to the customer that it be due to the cotton processing tax actually in that shirt there be about one pound of cotton and the processing tax amount to four and a quarter cent on that pound of cotton

 at this point it be only fair that i should give credit to the sixty or seventy million people who live in the city and large town of the nation for their understanding and their willingness to go along with the payment of even these small processing taxis though they know full well that the proportion of the process taxis on cotton good and on food product pay for by city dweller go one hundred per cent towards increase the agricultural income of the farm dweller of the land

 the last pillar of which i speak be that of the money of the country in the bank of the country there be two simple fact

 first the federal government be about to spend one billion dollar as an immediate loan on the frozen or non liquid asset of all bank close since january 1 1933 give a liberal appraisal to those asset this money will be in the hand of the depositor as quickly as it be humanly possible to get it out

 secondly the government bank deposit insurance on all account up to $ 2500 go into effect on january first we be now engage in see to it that on or before that date the banking capital structure will be build up by the government to the point that the bank will be in sound condition when the insurance go into effect

 finally i repeat what i have say on many occasion that ever since last march the definite policy of the government have be to restore commodity price level the object have be the attainment of such a level as will enable agriculture and industry once more to give work to the unemployed it have be to make possible the payment of public and private debt more nearly at the price level at which they be incur it have be gradually to restore a balance in the price structure so that farmer may exchange their product for the product of industry on a fair exchange basis it have be and be also the purpose to prevent price from rise beyond the point necessary to attain these end the permanent welfare and security of every class of our people ultimately depend on our attainment of these purpose

 obviously and because hundred of different kind of crop and industrial occupation in the huge territory that make up this nation be involve we can not reach the goal in only a few month we may take one year or two year or three year

 no one who consider the plain fact of our situation believe that commodity price especially agricultural price be high enough yet

 some people be put the cart before the horse they want a permanent revaluation of the dollar first it be the government&#39;s policy to restore the price level first i would not know and no one else could tell just what the permanent valuation of the dollar will be to guess at a permanent gold valuation now would certainly require later change cause by later fact

 when we have restore the price level we shall seek to establish and maintain a dollar which will not change its purchasing and debt pay power during the succeed generation i say that in my message to the american delegation in london last july and i say it now once more

 because of condition in this country and because of event beyond our control in other part of the world it become increasingly important to develop and apply the further measure which may be necessary from time to time to control the gold value of our own dollar at home

 our dollar be now altogether too greatly influence by the accident of international trade by the internal policy of other nation and by political disturbance in other continent therefore the united states must take firmly in its own hand the control of the gold value of our dollar this be necessary in order to prevent dollar disturbance from swinge we away from our ultimate goal namely the continue recovery of our commodity price

 as a further effective mean to this end i be go to establish a government market for gold in the united states therefore under the clearly define authority of exist law i be authorize the reconstruction finance corporation to buy gold newly mine in the united states at price to be determine from time to time after consultation with the secretary of the treasury and the president whenever necessary to the end in view we shall also buy or sell gold in the world market

 my aim in take this step be to establish and maintain continuous control this be a policy and not an expedient it be not to be use merely to offset a temporary fall in price we be thus continue to move towards a manage currency

 you will recall the dire prediction make last spring by those who do not agree with our common policy of raise price by direct mean what actually happen stand out in sharp contrast with those prediction government credit be high price have rise in part doubtless prophet of evil still exist in our midst but government credit will be maintain and a sound currency will accompany a rise in the american commodity price level

 i have tell you tonight the story of our steady but sure work in build our common recovery in my promise to you both before and after march 4th i make two thing plain first that i pledge no miracle and second that i would do my good

 i thank you for your patience and your faith our trouble will not be over tomorrow but we be on our way and we be head in the right direction
it have be several month since i have talk with you concern the problem of government since january those of we in whom you have vested responsibility have be engage in the fulfillment of plan and policy which have be widely discuss in previous month it seem to we our duty not only to make the right path clear but also to tread that path as we review the achievement of this session of the seventy third congress it be make increasingly clear that its task be essentially that of complete and fortify the work it have begin in march 1933

 that be no easy task but the congress be equal to it it have be well say that while there be a few exception this congress display a great freedom from mere partisanship than any other peace time congress since the administration of president washington himself the session be distinguish by the extent and variety of legislation enact and by the intelligence and good will of debate upon these measure
 i mention only a few of the major enactment it provide for the readjustment of the debt burden through the corporate and municipal bankruptcy act and the farm relief act it lend a hand to industry by encourage loan to solvent industry unable to secure adequate help from banking institution it strengthen the integrity of finance through the regulation of security exchange it provide a rational method of increase our volume of foreign trade through reciprocal trading agreement it strengthen our naval force to conform with the intention and permission of exist treaty right it make further advance towards peace in industry through the labor adjustment act it supplement our agricultural policy through measure widely demand by farmer themselves and intend to avert price destroy surplus it strengthen the hand of the federal government in its attempt to suppress gangster crime it take definite step towards a national housing program through an act which i sign today design to encourage private capital in the rebuilding of the home of the nation it create a permanent federal body for the just regulation of all form of communication include the telephone the telegraph and the radio finally and i believe most important it reorganize simplify and make more fair and just our monetary system set up standard and policy adequate to meet the necessity of modern economic life do justice to both gold and silver as the metal basis behind the currency of the united states

 in the consistent development of our previous effort toward the saving and safeguarding of our national life i have continue to recognize three relate step the first be relief because the primary concern of any government dominate by the humane ideal of democracy be the simple principle that in a land of vast resource no one should be permit to starve relief be and continue to be our first consideration it call for large expenditure and will continue in modify form to do so for a long time to come we may as well recognize that fact it come from the paralysis that arise as the after effect of that unfortunate decade characterize by a mad chase for unearned rich and an unwillingness of leader in almost every walk of life to look beyond their own scheme and speculation in our administration of relief we follow two principle first that direct giving shall wherever possible be supplement by provision for useful and remunerative work and second that where family in their exist surrounding will in all human probability never find an opportunity for full self maintenance happiness and enjoyment we will try to give they a new chance in new surrounding

 the second step be recovery and it be sufficient for i to ask each and every one of you to compare the situation in agriculture and in industry today with what it be fifteen month ago

 at the same time we have recognize the necessity of reform and reconstruction --reform because much of our trouble today and in the past few year have be due to a lack of understanding of the elementary principle of justice and fairness by those in whom leadership in business and finance be place reconstruction because new condition in our economic life as well as old but neglect condition have to be correct

 substantial gain well know to all of you have justify our course i could cite statistic to you as unanswerable measure of our national progress statistic to show the gain in the average weekly pay envelope of worker in the great majority of industry --statistics to show hundred of thousand reemploye in private industry and other hundred of thousand give new employment through the expansion of direct and indirect government assistance of many kind although of course there be those exception in professional pursuit whose economic improvement of necessity will be delay i also could cite statistic to show the great rise in the value of farm product statistic to prove the demand for consumer good range all the way from food and clothing to automobile and of late to prove the rise in the demand for durable good statistic to cover the great increase in bank deposit and to show the score of thousand of home and of farm which have be save from foreclosure

 but the simple way for each of you to judge recovery lie in the plain fact of your own individual situation be you well off than you be last year be your debt less burdensome be your bank account more secure be your working condition well be your faith in your own individual future more firmly ground

 also let i put to you another simple question have you as an individual pay too high a price for these gain plausible self seeker and theoretical die hard will tell you of the loss of individual liberty answer this question also out of the fact of your own life have you lose any of your right or liberty or constitutional freedom of action and choice turn to the bill of rights of the constitution which i have solemnly swear to maintain and under which your freedom rest secure read each provision of that bill of rights and ask yourself whether you personally have suffer the impairment of a single jot of these great assurance i have no question in my mind as to what your answer will be the record be write in the experience of your own personal life

 in other word it be not the overwhelming majority of the farmer or manufacturer or worker who deny the substantial gain of the past year the most vociferous of the doubt thomases may be divide roughly into two group first those who seek special political privilege and second those who seek special financial privilege about a year ago i use as an illustration the 90 percent of the cotton manufacturer of the united states who want to do the right thing by their employee and by the public but be prevent from do so by the 10 percent who undercut they by unfair practice and un american standard it be well for we to remember that humanity be a long way from be perfect and that a selfish minority in every walk of life farming business finance and even government service itself will always continue to think of themselves first and their fellow being second

 in the working out of a great national program which seek the primary good of the great number it be true that the toe of some people be be step on and be go to be step on but these toe belong to the comparative few who seek to retain or to gain position or rich or both by some short cut which be harmful to the great good

 in the execution of the power confer on it by congress the administration need and will tirelessly seek the good ability that the country afford public service offer well reward in the opportunity for service than ever before in our history not great salary but enough to live on in the building of this service there be come to us man and woman with ability and courage from every part of the union the day of the seeking of mere party advantage through the misuse of public power be draw to a close we be increasingly demand and get devotion to the public service on the part of every member of the administration high and low

 the program of the past year be definitely in operation and that operation month by month be be make to fit into the web of old and new condition this process of evolution be well illustrate by the constant change in detailed organization and method go on in the national recovery administration with every pass month we be make stride in the orderly handling of the relationship between employee and employer condition differ of course in almost every part of the country and in almost every industry temporary method of adjustment be be replace by more permanent machinery and i be glad to say by a grow recognition on the part of employer and employee of the desirability of maintain fair relationship all around

 so also while almost everybody have recognize the tremendous stride in the elimination of child labor in the payment of not less than fair minimum wage and in the shortening of hour we be still feel our way in solve problem which relate to self government in industry especially where such self government tend to eliminate the fair operation of competition

 in this same process of evolution we be keep before we the objective of protect on the one hand industry against chiseler within its own rank and on the other hand the consumer through the maintenance of reasonable competition for the prevention of the unfair sky rocketing of retail price

 but in addition to this our immediate task we must still look to the large future i have point out to the congress that we be seek to find the way once more to well know long established but to some degree forget ideal and value we seek the security of the man woman and child of the nation

 that security involve add mean of provide well home for the people of the nation that be the first principle of our future program

 the second be to plan the use of land and water resource of this country to the end that the mean of livelihood of our citizen may be more adequate to meet their daily need

 and finally the third principle be to use the agency of government to assist in the establishment of mean to provide sound and adequate protection against the vicissitude of modern life in other word social insurance

 later in the year i hope to talk with you more fully about these plan a few timid people who fear progress will try to give you new and strange name for what we be do sometimes they will call it fascism sometimes communism sometimes regimentation sometimes socialism but in so do they be try to make very complex and theoretical something that be really very simple and very practical

 i believe in practical explanation and in practical policy i believe that what we be do today be a necessary fulfillment of what americans have always be do a fulfillment of old and test american ideal

 let i give you a simple illustration while i be away from washington this summer a long need renovation of and addition to our white house office building be to be start the architect have plan a few new room build into the present all too small one story structure we be go to include in this addition and in this renovation modern electric wiring and modern plumbing and modern mean of keep the office cool in the hot washington summer but the structural line of the old executive office building will remain the artistic line of the white house building be the creation of master builder when our republic be young the simplicity and the strength of the structure remain in the face of every modern test but within this magnificent pattern the necessity of modern government business require constant reorganization and rebuilding

 if i be to listen to the argument of some prophet of calamity who be talk these day i should hesitate to make these alteration i should fear that while i be away for a few week the architect might build some strange new gothic tower or a factory building or perhaps a replica of the kremlin or of the potsdam palace but i have no such fear the architect and builder be man of common sense and of artistic american taste they know that the principle of harmony and of necessity itself require that the building of the new structure shall blend with the essential line of the old it be this combination of the old and the new that mark orderly peaceful progress not only in build building but in build government itself

 our new structure be a part of and a fulfillment of the old

 all that we do seek to fulfill the historic tradition of the american people other nation may sacrifice democracy for the transitory stimulation of old and discredited autocracy we be restore confidence and well being under the rule of the people themselves we remain as john marshall say a century ago emphatically and truly a government of the people our government in form and in substance emanate from they its power be grant by they and be to be exercise directly on they and for their benefit

 before i close i want to tell you of the interest and pleasure with which i look forward to the trip on which i hope to start in a few day it be a good thing for everyone who can possibly do so to get away at least once a year for a change of scene i do not want to get into the position of not be able to see the forest because of the thickness of the tree

 i hope to visit our fellow americans in puerto rico in the virgin islands in the canal zone and in hawaii and incidentally it will give i an opportunity to exchange a friendly word of greeting to the president of our sister republics haiti colombia and panama

 after four week on board ship i plan to land at a port in our pacific northwest and then will come the good part of the whole trip for i be hope to inspect a number of our new great national project on the columbia missouri and mississippi rivers to see some of our national park and incidentally to learn much of actual condition during the trip across the continent back to washington

 while i be in france during the war our boy use to call the united states god 's country let we make it and keep it god 's country

three month have pass since i talk with you shortly after the adjournment of the congress tonight i continue that report though because of the shortness of time i must defer a number of subject to a later date
 recently the most notable public question that have concern we all have have to do with industry and labor and with respect to these certain development have take place which i consider of importance i be happy to report that after year of uncertainty culminate in the collapse of the spring of 1933 we be bring order out of the old chaos with a great certainty of the employment of labor at a reasonable wage and of more business at a fair profit these governmental and industrial development hold promise of new achievement for the nation
 man may differ as to the particular form of governmental activity with respect to industry and business but nearly all be agree that private enterprise in time such as these can not be leave without assistance and without reasonable safeguard lest it destroy not only itself but also our process of civilization the underlying necessity for such activity be indeed as strong now as it be year ago when elihu root say the follow very significant word
 instead of the give and take of free individual contract the tremendous power of organization have combine great aggregation of capital in enormous industrial establishment work through vast agency of commerce and employ great masse of man in movement of production and transportation and trade so great in the mass that each individual concern in they be quite helpless by himself the relation between the employer and the employ between the owner of aggregated capital and the unit of organize labor between the small producer the small trader the consumer and the great transporting and manufacture and distribute agency all present new question for the solution of which the old reliance upon the free action of individual will appear quite inadequate and in many direction the intervention of that organize control which we call government seem necessary to produce the same result of justice and right conduct which obtain through the attrition of individual before the new condition arise
 it be in this spirit thus describe by secretary root that we approach our task of revive private enterprise in march 1933 our first problem be of course the banking situation because as you know the bank have collapse some bank could not be save but the great majority of they either through their own resource or with government aid have be restore to complete public confidence this have give safety to million of depositor in these bank closely follow this great constructive effort we have through various federal agency save debtor and creditor alike in many other field of enterprise such as loan on farm mortgage and home mortgage loan to the railroad and insurance company and finally help for home owner and industry itself
 in all of these effort the government have come to the assistance of business and with the full expectation that the money use to assist these enterprise will eventually be repay i believe it will be
 the second step we have take in the restoration of normal business enterprise have be to clean up thoroughly unwholesome condition in the field of investment in this we have have assistance from many banker and businessman most of whom recognize the past evil in the banking system in the sale of security in the deliberate encouragement of stock gambling in the sale of unsound mortgage and in many other way in which the public lose billion of dollar they see that without change in the policy and method of investment there could be no recovery of public confidence in the security of saving the country now enjoy the safety of bank saving under the new banking law the careful checking of new security under the securities act and the curtailment of rank stock speculation through the securities exchange act i sincerely hope that as a result people will be discourage in unhappy effort to get rich quick by speculate in security the average person almost always lose only a very small minority of the people of this country believe in gambling as a substitute for the old philosophy of benjamin franklin that the way to wealth be through work
 in meet the problem of industrial recovery the chief agency of the government have be the national recovery administration under its guidance trade and industry cover over ninety percent of all industrial employee have adopt code of fair competition which have be approve by the president under these code in the industry cover child labor have be eliminate the work day and the work week have be shorten minimum wage have be establish and other wage adjust toward a rise standard of living the emergency purpose of the n. r. a. be to put man to work and since its creation more than four million person have be re employ in great part through the cooperation of american business bring about under the code
 benefit of the industrial recovery program have come not only to labor in the form of new job in relief from over work and in relief from under pay but also to the owner and manager of industry because together with a great increase in the payroll there have come a substantial rise in the total of industrial profit a rise from a deficit figure in the first quarter of 1933 to a level of sustained profit within one year from the inauguration of n. r. a.
 now it should not be expect that even employ labor and capital would be completely satisfied with present condition employ worker have not by any mean all enjoy a return to the earning of prosperous time although million of hitherto under- privileged worker be today far well pay than ever before also billion of dollar of invest capital have today a great security of present and future earn power than before this be because of the establishment of fair competitive standard and because of relief from unfair competition in wage cutting which depress market and destroy purchase power but it be an undeniable fact that the restoration of other billion of sound investment to a reasonable earning power could not be bring about in one year there be no magic formula no economic panacea which could simply revive over night the heavy industry and the trade dependent upon they
 nevertheless the gain of trade and industry as a whole have be substantial in these gain and in the policy of the administration there be assurance that hearten all forward look man and woman with the confidence that we be definitely rebuild our political and economic system on the line lay down by the new deal line which as i have so often make clear be in complete accord with the underlie principle of orderly popular government which americans have demand since the white man first come to these shore we count in the future as in the past on the drive power of individual initiative and the incentive of fair private profit strengthen with the acceptance of those obligation to the public interest which rest upon we all we have the right to expect that this drive power will be give patriotically and whole heartedly to our nation
 we have pass through the formative period of code making in the national recovery administration and have effect a reorganization of the n. r. a. suit to the need of the next phase which be in turn a period of preparation for legislation which will determine its permanent form
 in this recent reorganization we have recognize three distinct function first the legislative or policy making function second the administrative function of code making and revision and third the judicial function which include enforcement consumer complaint and the settlement of dispute between employer and employee and between one employer and another
 we be now prepared to move into this second phase on the basis of our experience in the first phase under the able and energetic leadership of general johnson
 we shall watch carefully the working of this new machinery for the second phase of n. r. a. modify it where it need modification and finally make recommendation to the congress in order that the function of n. r. a. which have prove their worth may be make a part of the permanent machinery of government
 let i call your attention to the fact that the national industrial recovery act give businessman the opportunity they have seek for year to improve business condition through what have be call self government in industry if the code which have be write have be too complicated if they have go too far in such matter as price fixing and limitation of production let it be remember that so far as possible consistent with the immediate public interest of this past year and the vital necessity of improve labor condition the representative of trade and industry be permit to write their idea into the code it be now time to review these action as a whole to determine through deliberative mean in the light of experience from the standpoint of the good of the industry themselves as well as the general public interest whether the method and policy adopt in the emergency have be well calculate to promote industrial recovery and a permanent improvement of business and labor condition there may be a serious question as to the wisdom of many of those device to control production or to prevent destructive price cutting which many business organization have insist be necessary or whether their effect may have be to prevent that volume of production which would make possible low price and increase employment another question arise as to whether in fix minimum wage on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage we have reach into the heart of the problem which be to provide such annual earning for the low pay worker as will meet his minimum need we also question the wisdom of extend code requirement suit to the great industrial center and to large employer to the great number of small employer in the small community
 during the last twelve month our industrial recovery have be to some extent retard by strike include a few of major importance i would not minimize the inevitable loss to employer and employee and to the general public through such conflict but i would point out that the extent and severity of labor dispute during this period have be far less than in any previous comparable period
 when the businessman of the country be demand the right to organize themselves adequately to promote their legitimate interest when the farmer be demand legislation which would give they opportunity and incentive to organize themselves for a common advance it be natural that the worker should seek and obtain a statutory declaration of their constitutional right to organize themselves for collective bargaining as embody in section 7 a of the national industrial recovery act
 machinery set up by the federal government have provide some new method of adjustment both employer and employee mast share the blame of not use they as fully as they should the employer who turn away from impartial agency of peace who deny freedom of organization to his employee or fail to make every reasonable effort at a peaceful solution of their difference be not fully support the recovery effort of his government the worker who turn away from these same impartial agency and decline to use their good office to gain their end be likewise not fully cooperate with their government
 it be time that we make a clean cut effort to bring about that united action of management and labor which be one of the high purpose of the recovery act we have pass through more than a year of education step by step we have create all the government agency necessary to insure as a general rule industrial peace with justice for all those willing to use these agency whenever their voluntary bargaining fail to produce a necessary agreement
 there should be at least a full and fair trial give to these mean of end industrial warfare and in such an effort we should be able to secure for employer and employee and consumer the benefit that all derive from the continuous peaceful operation of our essential enterprise
 accordingly i propose to confer within the come month with small group of those truly representative of large employer of labor and of large group of organize labor in order to seek their cooperation in establish what i may describe as a specific trial period of industrial peace
 from those willing to join in establish this hope for period of peace i shall seek assurance of the making and maintenance of agreement which can be mutually rely upon under which wage hour and working condition may be determine and any later adjustment shall be make either by agreement or in case of disagreement through the mediation or arbitration of state or federal agency i shall not ask either employer or employee permanently to lay aside the weapon common to industrial war but i shall ask both group to give a fair trial to peaceful method of adjust their conflict of opinion and interest and to experiment for a reasonable time with measure suitable to civilize our industrial civilization
 closely ally to the n. r. a. be the program of public works provide for in the same act and design to put more man back to work both directly on the public work themselves and indirectly in the industry supply the material for these public work to those who say that our expenditure for public works and other mean for recovery be a waste that we can not afford i answer that no country however rich can afford the waste of its human resource demoralization cause by vast unemployment be our great extravagance morally it be the great menace to our social order some people try to tell i that we must make up our mind that for the future we shall permanently have million of unemployed just as other country have have they for over a decade what may be necessary for those country be not my responsibility to determine but as for this country i stand or fall by my refusal to accept as a necessary condition of our future a permanent army of unemployed on the contrary we must make it a national principle that we will not tolerate a large army of unemployed and that we will arrange our national economy to end our present unemployment as soon as we can and then to take wise measure against its return i do not want to think that it be the destiny of any american to remain permanently on relief roll
 those fortunately few in number who be frighten by boldness and cow by the necessity for make decision complain that all we have do be unnecessary and subject to great risk now that these people be come out of their storm cellar they forget that there ever be a storm they point to england they would have you believe that england have make progress out of her depression by a do nothing policy by let nature take she course england have her peculiarity and we have our but i do not believe any intelligent observer can accuse england of undue orthodoxy in the present emergency
 do england let nature take she course no do england hold to the gold standard when her reserve be threaten no have england go back to the gold standard today no do england hesitate to call in ten billion dollar of her war bond bear 5 percent interest to issue new bond therefore bear only 3 1/2 percent interest thereby save the british treasury one hundred and fifty million dollar a year in interest alone no and let it be record that the british banker help be it not a fact that ever since the year 1909 great britain in many way have advance far along line of social security than the united states be it not a fact that relation between capital and labor on the basis of collective bargaining be much far advanced in great britain than in the united states it be perhaps not strange that the conservative british press have tell we with pardonable irony that much of our new deal program be only an attempt to catch up with english reform that go back ten year or more
 nearly all americans be sensible and calm people we do not get greatly excited nor be our peace of mind disturb whether we be businessman or worker or farmer by awesome pronouncement concern the unconstitutionality of some of our measure of recovery and relief and reform we be not frighten by reactionary lawyer or political editor all of these cry have be hear before more than twenty year ago when theodore roosevelt and woodrow wilson be attempt to correct abuse in our national life the great chief justice white say
 there be great danger it seem to i to arise from the constant habit which prevail where anything be oppose or object to of refer without rhyme or reason to the constitution as a means of prevent its accomplishment thus create the general impression that the constitution be but a barrier to progress instead of be the broad highway through which alone true progress may be enjoy
 in our effort for recovery we have avoid on the one hand the theory that business should and must be take over into an all embrace government we have avoid on the other hand the equally untenable theory that it be an interference with liberty to offer reasonable help when private enterprise be in need of help the course we have follow fit the american practice of government a practice of take action step by step of regulate only to meet concrete need a practice of courageous recognition of change i believe with abraham lincoln that the legitimate object of government be to do for a community of people whatever they need to have do but can not do at all or can not do so well for themselves in their separate and individual capacity
 i still believe in ideal i be not for a return to that definition of liberty under which for many year a free people be be gradually regiment into the service of the privileged few i prefer and i be sure you prefer that broad definition of liberty under which we be move forward to great freedom to great security for the average man than he have ever know before in the history of america

since my annual message to the congress on january fourth last i have not address the general public over the air in the many week since that time the congress have devote itself to the arduous task of formulate legislation necessary to the country 's welfare it have make and be make distinct progress
 before i come to any of the specific measure however i want to leave in your mind one clear fact the administration and the congress be not proceed in any haphazard fashion in this task of government each of our step have a definite relationship to every other step the job of create a program for the nation 's welfare be in some respect like the building of a ship at different point on the coast where i often visit they build great seagoe ship when one of these ship be under construction and the steel frame have be set in the keel it be difficult for a person who do not know ship to tell how it will finally look when it be sail the high sea
 it may seem confuse to some but out of the multitude of detailed part that go into the making of the structure the creation of a useful instrument for man ultimately come it be that way with the making of a national policy the objective of the nation have greatly change in three year before that time individual self interest and group selfishness be paramount in public thinking the general good be at a discount
 three year of hard thinking have change the picture more and more people because of clear thinking and a well understanding be consider the whole rather than a mere part relate to one section or to one crop or to one industry or to an individual private occupation that be a tremendous gain for the principle of democracy the overwhelming majority of people in this country know how to sift the wheat from the chaff in what they hear and what they read they know that the process of the constructive rebuilding of america can not be do in a day or a year but that it be be do in spite of the few who seek to confuse they and to profit by their confusion american as a whole be feel a lot well a lot more cheerful than for many many year
 the most difficult place in the world to get a clear open perspective of the country as a whole be washington i be remind sometimes of what president wilson once say so many people come to washington who know thing that be not so and so few people who know anything about what the people of the united states be think about that be why i occasionally leave this scene of action for a few day to go fishing or back home to hyde park so that i can have a chance to think quietly about the country as a whole to get away from the tree as they say and to look at the whole forest this duty of see the country in a long range perspective be one which in a very special manner attach to this office to which you have choose i do you ever stop to think that there be after all only two position in the nation that be fill by the vote of all of the voter the president and the vice president that make it particularly necessary for the vice president and for i to conceive of our duty toward the entire country i speak therefore tonight to and of the american people as a whole
 my most immediate concern be in carry out the purpose of the great work program just enact by the congress its first objective be to put man and woman now on the relief roll to work and incidentally to assist materially in our already unmistakable march toward recovery i shall not confuse my discussion by a multitude of figure so many figure be quote to prove so many thing sometimes it depend upon what paper you read and what broadcast you hear therefore let we keep our mind on two or three simple essential fact in connection with this problem of unemployment it be true that while business and industry be definitely well our relief roll be still too large however for the first time in five year the relief roll have decline instead of increase during the winter month they be still decline the simple fact be that many million more people have private work today than two year ago today or one year ago today and every day that pass offer more chance to work for those who want to work in spite of the fact that unemployment remain a serious problem here as in every other nation we have come to recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful remedial measure these measure be of two kind the first be to make provision intend to relieve to minimize and to prevent future unemployment the second be to establish the practical mean to help those who be unemployed in this present emergency our social security legislation be an attempt to answer the first of these question our work relief program the second
 the program for social security now pende before the congress be a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government while our present and project expenditure for work relief be wholly within the reasonable limit of our national credit resource it be obvious that we can not continue to create governmental deficit for that purpose year after year we must begin now to make provision for the future that be why our social security program be an important part of the complete picture it propose by mean of old age pension to help those who have reach the age of retirement to give up their job and thus give to the young generation great opportunity for work and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age
 the unemployment insurance part of the legislation will not only help to guard the individual in future period of lay off against dependence upon relief but it will by sustain purchasing power cushion the shock of economic distress another helpful feature of unemployment insurance be the incentive it will give to employer to plan more carefully in order that unemployment may be prevent by the stabilizing of employment itself
 provision for social security however be protection for the future our responsibility for the immediate necessity of the unemployed have be meet by the congress through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation our problem be to put to work three and one half million employable person now on the relief roll it be a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government
 we be lose no time get the government 's vast work relief program underway and we have every reason to believe that it should be in full swing by autumn in direct it i shall recognize six fundamental principle
 1 the project should be useful
 2 project shall be of a nature that a considerable proportion of the money spend will go into wage for labor
 3 project which promise ultimate return to the federal treasury of a considerable proportion of the cost will be seek
 4 fund allot for each project should be actually and promptly spend and not hold over until later year
 5 in all case project must be of a character to give employment to those on the relief roll
 6 project will be allocate to locality or relief area in relation to the number of worker on relief roll in those area
 i next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work
 1 i have set up a division of applications and information to which all proposal for the expenditure of money must go for preliminary study and consideration
 2 after the division of applications and information have sift those project they will be send to an allotment division compose of representative of the more important governmental agency charge with carry on work relief project the group will also include representative of city and of labor farming banking and industry this allotment division will consider all of the recommendation submit to it and such project as they approve will be next submit to the president who under the act be require to make final allocation
 3 the next step will be to notify the proper government agency in whose field the project fall and also to notify another agency which i be create a progress division this division will have the duty of coordinate the purchase of material and supply and of make certain that people who be employ will be take from the relief roll it will also have the responsibility of determine work payment in various locality of make full use of exist employment service and to assist people engage in relief work to move as rapidly as possible back into private employment when such employment be available moreover this division will be charge with keep project move on schedule
 4 i have feel it to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid so far as possible the creation of new governmental machinery for supervise this work the national government now have at least sixty different agency with the staff and the experience and the competence necessary to carry on the two hundred and fifty or three hundred kind of work that will be undertake these agency therefore will simply be do on a somewhat enlarge scale the same sort of thing that they have be do this will make certain that the large possible portion of the fund allot will be spend for actually create new work and not for build up expensive overhead organization here in washington
 for many month preparation have be under way the allotment of fund for desirable project have already begin the key man for the major responsibility of this great task already have be select i well realize that the country be expect before this year be out to see the dirt fly as they say in carry on the work and i assure my fellow citizen that no energy will be spare in use these fund effectively to make a major attack upon the problem of unemployment
 our responsibility be to all of the people in this country this be a great national crusade to destroy enforce idleness which be an enemy of the human spirit generate by this depression our attack upon these enemy must be without stint and without discrimination no sectional no political distinction can be permit it must however be recognize that when an enterprise of this character be extend over more than three thousand county throughout the nation there may be occasional instance of inefficiency bad management or misuse of fund when case of this kind occur there will be those of course who will try to tell you that the exceptional failure be characteristic of the entire endeavor it should be remember that in every big job there be some imperfection there be chiseler in every walk of life there be those in every industry who be guilty of unfair practice every profession have its black sheep but long experience in government have teach i that the exceptional instance of wrong doing in government be probably less numerous than in almost every other line of endeavor the most effective mean of prevent such evil in this work relief program will be the eternal vigilance of the american people themselves i call upon my fellow citizen everywhere to cooperate with i in make this the most efficient and the clean example of public enterprise the world have ever see it be time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical man who say that a democracy can not be honest and efficient if you will help this can be do i therefore hope you will watch the work in every corner of this nation feel free to criticize tell i of instance where work can be do well or where improper practice prevail neither you nor i want criticism conceive in a purely fault finding or partisan spirit but i be jealous of the right of every citizen to call to the attention of his or her government example of how the public money can be more effectively spend for the benefit of the american people
 i now come my friend to a part of the remain business before the congress it have under consideration many measure which provide for the round out of the program of economic and social reconstruction with which we have be concern for two year i can mention only a few of they tonight but i do not want my mention of specific measure to be interpret as lack of interest in or disapproval of many other important proposal that be pende
 the national industrial recovery act expire on the sixteenth of june after careful consideration i have ask the congress to extend the life of this useful agency of government as we have proceed with the administration of this act we have find from time to time more and more useful way of promote its purpose no reasonable person want to abandon our present gain we must continue to protect child to enforce minimum wage to prevent excessive hour to safeguard define and enforce collective bargaining and while retain fair competition to eliminate so far as humanly possible the kind of unfair practice by selfish minority which unfortunately do more than anything else to bring about the recent collapse of industry
 there be likewise pende before the congress legislation to provide for the elimination of unnecessary hold company in the public utility field
 i consider this legislation a positive recovery measure power production in this country be virtually back to the 1929 peak the operate company in the gas and electric utility field be by and large in good condition but under hold company domination the utility industry have long be hopelessly at war within itself and with public sentiment by far the great part of the general decline in utility security have occur before i be inaugurate the absentee management of unnecessary hold company control have lose touch with and have lose the sympathy of the community it pretend to serve even more significantly it have give the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of over concentrate economic power
 a business that lose the confidence of its customer and the good will of the public can not long continue to be a good risk for the investor this legislation will serve the investor by end the condition which have cause that lack of confidence and good will it will put the public utility operating industry on a sound basis for the future both in its public relation and in its internal relation
 this legislation will not only in the long run result in provide low electric and gas rate to the consumer but it will protect the actual value and earn power of property now own by thousand of investor who have little protection under the old law against what use to be call frenzied finance it will not destroy value
 not only business recovery but the general economic recovery of the nation will be greatly stimulate by the enactment of legislation design to improve the status of our transportation agency there be need for legislation provide for the regulation of interstate transportation by bus and truck to regulate transportation by water new provision for strengthen our merchant marine and air transport measure for the strengthening of the interstate commerce commission to enable it to carry out a rounded conception of the national transportation system in which the benefit of private ownership be retain while the public stake in these important service be protect by the public 's government
 finally the reestablishment of public confidence in the bank of the nation be one of the most hopeful result of our effort as a nation to reestablish public confidence in private banking we all know that private banking actually exist by virtue of the permission of and regulation by the people as a whole speak through their government wise public policy however require not only that banking be safe but that its resource be most fully utilize in the economic life of the country to this end it be decide more than twenty year ago that the government should assume the responsibility of provide a mean by which the credit of the nation might be control not by a few private banking institution but by a body with public prestige and authority the answer to this demand be the federal reserve system twenty year of experience with this system have justify the effort make to create it but these twenty year have show by experience definite possibility for improvement certain proposal make to amend the federal reserve act deserve prompt and favorable action by the congress they be a minimum of wise readjustment of our federal reserve system in the light of past experience and present need
 these measure i have mention be in large part the program which under my constitutional duty i have recommend to the congress they be essential factor in a rounded program for national recovery they contemplate the enrichment of our national life by a sound and rational ordering of its various element and wise provision for the protection of the weak against the strong never since my inauguration in march 1933 have i feel so unmistakably the atmosphere of recovery but it be more than the recovery of the material basis of our individual life it be the recovery of confidence in our democratic process and institution we have survive all of the arduous burden and the threaten danger of a great economic calamity we have in the dark moment of our national trial retain our faith in our own ability to master our destiny fear be vanish and confidence be grow on every side renew faith in the vast possibility of human being to improve their material and spiritual status through the instrumentality of the democratic form of government that faith be receive its just reward for that we can be thankful to the god who watch over america

senator robinson members of the democratic convention my friend

 here and in every community throughout the land we be meet at a time of great moment to the future of the nation it be an occasion to be dedicate to the simple and sincere expression of an attitude toward problem the determination of which will profoundly affect america

 i come not only as a leader of a party not only as a candidate for high office but as one upon whom many critical hour have impose and still impose a grave responsibility

 for the sympathy help and confidence with which americans have sustain i in my task i be grateful for their loyalty i salute the member of our great party in and out of political life in every part of the union i salute those of other party especially those in the congress of the united states who on so many occasion have put partisanship aside i thank the governors of the several states their legislatures their state and local official who participate unselfishly and regardless of party in our effort to achieve recovery and destroy abuse above all i thank the million of americans who have bear disaster bravely and have dare to smile through the storm

 america will not forget these recent year will not forget that the rescue be not a mere party task it be the concern of all of we in our strength we rise together rally our energy together apply the old rule of common sense and together survive

 in those day we fear fear that be why we fight fear and today my friend we have win against the most dangerous of our foe we have conquer fear

 but i can not with candor tell you that all be well with the world cloud of suspicion tide of ill will and intolerance gather darkly in many place in our own land we enjoy indeed a fullness of life great than that of most nation but the rush of modern civilization itself have raise for we new difficulty new problem which must be solve if we be to preserve to the united states the political and economic freedom for which washington and jefferson plan and fight

 philadelphia be a good city in which to write american history this be fitting ground on which to reaffirm the faith of our father to pledge ourselves to restore to the people a wide freedom to give to 1936 as the founder give to 1776 an american way of life

 that very word freedom in itself and of necessity suggest freedom from some restraining power in 1776 we seek freedom from the tyranny of a political autocracy from the eighteenth century royalist who hold special privilege from the crown it be to perpetuate their privilege that they govern without the consent of the govern that they deny the right of free assembly and free speech that they restrict the worship of god that they put the average man 's property and the average man 's life in pawn to the mercenary of dynastic power that they regiment the people

 and so it be to win freedom from the tyranny of political autocracy that the american revolution be fight that victory give the business of govern into the hand of the average man who win the right with his neighbor to make and order his own destiny through his own government political tyranny be wipe out at philadelphia on july 4 1776

 since that struggle however man 's inventive genius release new force in our land which reorder the life of our people the age of machinery of railroad of steam and electricity the telegraph and the radio mass production mass distribution all of these combine to bring forward a new civilization and with it a new problem for those who seek to remain free

 for out of this modern civilization economic royalist carve new dynasty new kingdom be build upon concentration of control over material thing through new use of corporation bank and security new machinery of industry and agriculture of labor and capital all undreame of by the father the whole structure of modern life be impress into this royal service

 there be no place among this royalty for our many thousand of small business man and merchant who seek to make a worthy use of the american system of initiative and profit they be no more free than the worker or the farmer even honest and progressive minded man of wealth aware of their obligation to their generation could never know just where they fit into this dynastic scheme of thing

 it be natural and perhaps human that the privileged prince of these new economic dynasty thirst for power reach out for control over government itself they create a new despotism and wrap it in the robe of legal sanction in its service new mercenary seek to regiment the people their labor and their property and as a result the average man once more confront the problem that face the minute man

 the hour man and woman work the wage they receive the condition of their labor these have pass beyond the control of the people and be impose by this new industrial dictatorship the saving of the average family the capital of the small business man the investment set aside for old age other people 's money these be tool which the new economic royalty use to dig itself in

 those who till the soil no long reap the reward which be their right the small measure of their gain be decree by man in distant city

 throughout the nation opportunity be limit by monopoly individual initiative be crush in the cog of a great machine the field open for free business be more and more restrict private enterprise indeed become too private it become privileged enterprise not free enterprise

 an old english judge once say necessitous man be not free man liberty require opportunity to make a living a live decent accord to the standard of the time a living which give man not only enough to live by but something to live for

 for too many of we the political equality we once have win be meaningless in the face of economic inequality a small group have concentrate into their own hand an almost complete control over other people 's property other people 's money other people 's labor other people 's life for too many of we life be no long free liberty no long real man could no long follow the pursuit of happiness

 against economic tyranny such as this the american citizen could appeal only to the organize power of government the collapse of 1929 show up the despotism for what it be the election of 1932 be the people 's mandate to end it under that mandate it be be end

 the royalist of the economic order have concede that political freedom be the business of the government but they have maintain that economic slavery be nobody 's business they grant that the government could protect the citizen in his right to vote but they deny that the government could do anything to protect the citizen in his right to work and his right to live

 today we stand committed to the proposition that freedom be no half and half affair if the average citizen be guarantee equal opportunity in the polling place he must have equal opportunity in the market place

 these economic royalist complain that we seek to overthrow the institution of america what they really complain of be that we seek to take away their power our allegiance to american institution require the overthrow of this kind of power in vain they seek to hide behind the flag and the constitution in their blindness they forget what the flag and the constitution stand for now as always they stand for democracy not tyranny for freedom not subjection and against a dictatorship by mob rule and the over privileged alike

 the brave and clear platform adopt by this convention to which i heartily subscribe set forth that government in a modern civilization have certain inescapable obligation to its citizen among which be protection of the family and the home the establishment of a democracy of opportunity and aid to those overtake by disaster

 but the resolute enemy within our gate be ever ready to beat down our word unless in great courage we will fight for they

 for more than three year we have fight for they this convention in every word and deed have pledge that that fight will go on

 the defeat and victory of these year have give to we as a people a new understanding of our government and of ourselves never since the early day of the new england town meeting have the affair of government be so widely discuss and so clearly appreciate it have be bring home to we that the only effective guide for the safety of this most worldly of world the great guide of all be moral principle

 we do not see faith hope and charity as unattainable ideal but we use they as stout support of a nation fight the fight for freedom in a modern civilization

 faith in the soundness of democracy in the midst of dictatorship

 hope renew because we know so well the progress we have make

 charity in the true spirit of that grand old word for charity literally translate from the original mean love the love that understand that do not merely share the wealth of the giver but in true sympathy and wisdom help man to help themselves

 we seek not merely to make government a mechanical implement but to give it the vibrant personal character that be the very embodiment of human charity

 we be poor indeed if this nation can not afford to lift from every recess of american life the dread fear of the unemployed that they be not need in the world we can not afford to accumulate a deficit in the book of human fortitude

 in the place of the palace of privilege we seek to build a temple out of faith and hope and charity

 it be a sobering thing my friend to be a servant of this great cause we try in our daily work to remember that the cause belong not to we but to the people the standard be not in the hand of you and i alone it be carry by america we seek daily to profit from experience to learn to do well as our task proceed

 government can err president do make mistake but the immortal dante tell we that divine justice weigh the sin of the cold blooded and the sin of the warm hearted in different scale

 well the occasional fault of a government that live in a spirit of charity than the consistent omission of a government freeze in the ice of its own indifference

 there be a mysterious cycle in human event to some generation much be give of other generation much be expect this generation of americans have a rendezvous with destiny

 in this world of our in other land there be some people who in time past have live and fight for freedom and seem to have grow too weary to carry on the fight they have sell their heritage of freedom for the illusion of a living they have yield their democracy

 i believe in my heart that only our success can stir their ancient hope they begin to know that here in america we be wage a great and successful war it be not alone a war against want and destitution and economic demoralization it be more than that it be a war for the survival of democracy we be fight to save a great and precious form of government for ourselves and for the world

 i accept the commission you have tender i i join with you i be enlist for the duration of the war

i have be on a journey of husbandry i go primarily to see at first hand condition in the drought state to see how effectively federal and local authority be take care of press problem of relief and also how they be to work together to defend the people of this country against the effect of future drought
 i see drought devastation in nine state i talk with family who have lose their wheat crop lose their corn crop lose their livestock lose the water in their well lose their garden and come through to the end of the summer without one dollar of cash resource face a winter without feed or food face a planting season without seed to put in the ground
 that be the extreme case but there be thousand and thousand of family on western farm who share the same difficulty
 i see cattleman who because of lack of grass or lack of winter feed have be compel to sell all but their breeding stock and will need help to carry even these through the come winter i see livestock keep alive only because water have be bring to they long distance in tank car i see other farm family who have not lose everything but who because they have make only partial crop must have some form of help if they be to continue farm next spring
 i shall never forget the field of wheat so blast by heat that they can not be harvest i shall never forget field after field of corn stunt earless and strip of leave for what the sun leave the grasshopper take i see brown pasture which would not keep a cow on fifty acre
 yet i would not have you think for a single minute that there be permanent disaster in these drought region or that the picture i see mean depopulate these area no crack earth no blister sun no burn wind no grasshopper be a permanent match for the indomitable american farmer and stockman and their wife and child who have carry on through desperate day and inspire we with their self reliance their tenacity and their courage it be their father task to make home it be their task to keep those home it be our task to help they with their fight
 first let i talk for a minute about this autumn and the come winter we have the option in the case of family who need actual subsistence of put they on the dole or put they to work they do not want to go on the dole and they be one thousand percent right we agree therefore that we must put they to work for a decent wage and when we reach that decision we kill two bird with one stone because these family will earn enough by work not only to subsist themselves but to buy food for their stock and seed for next year 's planting into this scheme of thing there fit of course the government lending agency which next year as in the past will help with production loan
 every governor with whom i have talk be in full accord with this program of do work for these farm family just as every governor agree that the individual state will take care of their unemployable but that the cost of employ those who be entirely able and willing to work must be bear by the federal government
 if then we know as we do today the approximate number of farm family who will require some form of work relief from now on through the winter we face the question of what kind of work they should do let i make it clear that this be not a new question because it have already be answer to a great or less extent in every one of the drought community begin in 1934 when we also have serious drought condition the state and federal government cooperate in plan a large number of project many of they directly aim at the alleviation of future drought condition in accordance with that program literally thousand of pond or small reservoir have be build in order to supply water for stock and to lift the level of the underground water to protect well from go dry thousand of well have be drill or deepen community lake have be create and irrigation project be be push
 water conservation by mean such as these be be expand as a result of this new drought all through the great plains area the western corn belt and in the state that lie far south in the middle west water conservation be not so press a problem here the work project run more to soil erosion control and the building of farm to market road
 spending like this be not waste it would spell future waste if we do not spend for such thing now these emergency work project provide money to buy food and clothing for the winter they keep the livestock on the farm they provide seed for a new crop and good of all they will conserve soil and water in the future in those area most frequently hit by drought
 if for example in some local area the water table continue to drop and the topsoil to blow away the land value will disappear with the water and the soil people on the farm will drift into the nearby city the city will have no farm trade and the worker in the city factory and store will have no job property value in the city will decline if on the other hand the farm within that area remain as farm with well water supply and no erosion the farm population will stay on the land and prosper and the nearby city will prosper too property value will increase instead of disappear that be why it be worth our while as a nation to spend money in order to save money
 i have however use the argument in relation only to a small area it hold good in its effect on the nation as a whole every state in the drought area be now do and always will do business with every state outside it the very existence of the man and woman work in the clothing factory of new york make clothe wear by farmer and their family of the worker in the steel mill in pittsburgh in the automobile factory of detroit and in the harvester factory of illinois depend upon the farmer ability to purchase the commodity they produce in the same way it be the purchase power of the worker in these factory in the city that enable they and their wife and child to eat more beef more pork more wheat more corn more fruit and more dairy product and to buy more clothing make from cotton wool and leather in a physical and a property sense as well as in a spiritual sense we be member one of another
 i want to make it clear that no simple panacea can be apply to the drought problem in the whole of the drought area plan must depend on local condition for these vary with annual rainfall soil characteristic altitude and topography water and soil conservation method may differ in one county from those in an adjoining county work to be do in the cattle and sheep country differ in type from work in the wheat country or work in the corn belt
 the great plains drought area committee have give i its preliminary recommendation for a long time program for that region use that report as a basis we be cooperate successfully and in entire accord with the governors and state planning board as we get this program into operation the people more and more will be able to maintain themselves securely on the land that will mean a steady decline in the relief burden which the federal government and state have have to assume in time of drought but more important it will mean a great contribution to general national prosperity by these region which have be hit by drought it will conserve and improve not only property value but human value the people in the drought area do not want to be dependent on federal state or any other kind of charity they want for themselves and their family an opportunity to share fairly by their own effort in the progress of america
 the farmer of america want a sound national agricultural policy in which a permanent land use program will have an important place they want assurance against another year like 1932 when they make good crop but have to sell they for price that mean ruin just as surely as do the drought sound policy must maintain farm price in good crop year as well as in bad crop year it must function when we have drought it must also function when we have bumper crop
 the maintenance of a fair equilibrium between farm price and the price of industrial product be an aim which we must keep ever before we just as we must give constant thought to the sufficiency of the food supply of the nation even in bad year our modern civilization can and should devise a more successful mean by which the excess supply of bumper year can be conserve for use in lean year
 on my trip i have be deeply impressed with the general efficiency of those agency of the federal state and local government which have move in on the immediate task create by the drought in 1934 none of we have preparation we work without blueprint and make the mistake of inexperience hindsight show we this but as time have go on we have be make few and few mistake remember that the federal and state government have do only broad planning actual work on a give project originate in the local community local need be list from local information local project be decide on only after obtain the recommendation and help of those in the local community who be well able to give it and it be worthy of note that on my entire trip though i ask the question dozen of time i hear no complaint against the character of a single work relief project
 the elect head of the state concern together with their state official and their expert from agricultural college and state planning board have show cooperation with and approval of the work which the federal government have head up i be grateful also to the man and woman in all these state who have accept leadership in the work in their locality
 in the drought area people be not afraid to use new method to meet change in nature and to correct mistake of the past if overgrazing have injure range land they be willing to reduce the grazing if certain wheat land should be return to pasture they be willing to cooperate if tree should be plant as windbreak or to stop erosion they will work with we if terracing or summer fallowing or crop rotation be call for they will carry they out they stand ready to fit and not to fight the way of nature
 we be help and shall continue to help the farmer to do those thing through local soil conservation committee and other cooperative local state and federal agency of government
 i have not the time tonight to deal with other and more comprehensive agricultural policy
 with this fine help we be tide over the present emergency we be go to conserve soil conserve water and conserve life we be go to have long time defense against both low price and drought we be go to have a farm policy that will serve the national welfare that be our hope for the future
 there be two reason why i want to end by talk about reemployment tomorrow be labor day the brave spirit with which so many million of work people be win their way out of depression deserve respect and admiration it be like the courage of the farmer in the drought area
 that be my first reason the second be that healthy employment condition stand equally with healthy agricultural condition as a buttress of national prosperity dependable employment at fair wage be just as important to the people in the town and city as good farm income be to agriculture our people must have the ability to buy the good they manufacture and the crop they produce thus city wage and farm buying power be the two strong leg that carry the nation forward
 re employment in industry be proceed rapidly government spending be in large part responsible for keep industry go and put it in a position to make this reemployment possible government order be the backlog of heavy industry government wage turn over and over again to make consumer purchasing power and to sustain every merchant in the community businessman with their business small and large have to be save private enterprise be necessary to any nation which seek to maintain the democratic form of government in their case just as certainly as in the case of drought stricken farmer government spending have save
 government having spend wisely to save it private industry begin to take worker off the roll of the government relief program until this administration we have no free employment service except in a few state and city because there be no unified employment service the worker force to move as industry move often travel over the country wander after job which seem always to travel just a little fast than he do he be often victimize by fraudulent practice of employment clearing house and the fact of employment opportunity be at the disposal neither of himself nor of the employer
 in 1933 the united states employment service be create a cooperative state and federal enterprise through which the federal government match dollar for dollar the fund provide by the state for register the occupation and skill of worker and for actually find job for these register worker in private industry the federal state cooperation have be splendid already employment service be operate in 32 state and the area not cover by they be serve by the federal government
 we have develop a nationwide service with seven hundred district office and one thousand branch office thus provide facility through which labor can learn of job available and employer can find worker
 last spring i express the hope that employer would realize their deep responsibility to take man off the relief roll and give they job in private enterprise subsequently i be tell by many employer that they be not satisfied with the information available concern the skill and experience of the worker on the relief roll on august 25th i allocate a relatively small sum to the employment service for the purpose of get well and more recent information in regard to those now actively at work on wpa projects information as to their skill and previous occupation and to keep the record of such man and woman up to date for maximum service in make they available to industry tonight i be announce the allocation of two and a half million dollar more to enable the employment service to make an even more intensive search then it have yet be equip to make to find opportunity in private employment for worker register with it
 tonight i urge the worker to cooperate with and take full advantage of this intensification of the work of the employment service this do not mean that there will be any lessening of our effort under our wpa and pwa and other work relief program until all worker have decent job in private employment at decent wage we do not surrender our responsibility to the unemployed we have have ample proof that it be the will of the american people that those who represent they in national state and local government should continue as long as necessary to discharge that responsibility but it do mean that the government want to use resource to get private work for those now employ on government work and thus to curtail to a minimum the government expenditure for direct employment
 tonight i ask employer large and small throughout the nation to use the help of the state and federal employment service whenever in the general pick up of business they require more worker
 tomorrow be labor day labor day in this country have never be a class holiday it have always be a national holiday it have never have more significance as a national holiday than it have now in other country the relationship of employer and employee have more or less be accept as a class relationship not readily to be break through in this country we insist as an essential of the american way of life that the employer employee relationship should be one between free man and equal we refuse to regard those who work with hand or brain as different from or inferior to those who live from their property we insist that labor be entitle to as much respect as property but our worker with hand and brain deserve more than respect for their labor they deserve practical protection in the opportunity to use their labor at a return adequate to support they at a decent and constantly rise standard of living and to accumulate a margin of security against the inevitable vicissitude of life
 the average man must have that twofold opportunity if we be to avoid the growth of a class conscious society in this country
 there be those who fail to read both the sign of the time and american history they would try to refuse the worker any effective power to bargain collectively to earn a decent livelihood and to acquire security it be those short sighted one not labor who threaten this country with that class dissension which in other country have lead to dictatorship and the establishment of fear and hatred as the dominant emotion in human life
 all american worker brain worker and manual worker alike and all the rest of we whose well being depend on theirs know that our need be one in build an orderly economic democracy in which all can profit and in which all can be secure from the kind of faulty economic direction which bring we to the brink of common ruin seven year ago
 there be no cleavage between white collar worker and manual worker between artist and artisan musician and mechanic lawyer and accountant and architect and miner
 tomorrow labor day belong to all of we tomorrow labor day symbolize the hope of all americans anyone who call it a class holiday challenge the whole concept of american democracy
 the fourth of july commemorate our political freedom a freedom which without economic freedom be meaningless indeed labor day symbolize our determination to achieve an economic freedom for the average man which will give his political freedom reality

senator wagner governor lehman lady and gentleman

 on the eve of a national election it be well for we to stop for a moment and analyze calmly and without prejudice the effect on our nation of a victory by either of the major political party

 the problem of the electorate be far deep far more vital than the continuance in the presidency of any individual for the great issue go beyond unit of humanity it go to humanity itself

 in 1932 the issue be the restoration of american democracy and the american people be in a mood to win they do win in 1936 the issue be the preservation of their victory again they be in a mood to win again they will win

 more than four year ago in accept the democratic nomination in chicago i say give i your help not to win vote alone but to win in this crusade to restore america to its own people

 the banner of that crusade still fly in the van of a nation that be on the march

 it be needless to repeat the detail of the program which this administration have be hammer out on the anvil of experience no amount of misrepresentation or statistical contortion can conceal or blur or smear that record neither the attack of unscrupulous enemy nor the exaggeration of over zealous friend will serve to mislead the american people

 what be our hope in 1932 above all other thing the american people want peace they want peace of mind instead of gnaw fear

 first they seek escape from the personal terror which have stalk they for three year they want the peace that come from security in their home safety for their saving permanence in their job a fair profit from their enterprise

 next they want peace in the community the peace that spring from the ability to meet the need of community life school playground park sanitation highway those thing which be expect of solvent local government they seek escape from disintegration and bankruptcy in local and state affair

 they also seek peace within the nation protection of their currency fair wage the ending of long hour of toil the abolition of child labor the elimination of wild cat speculation the safety of their child from kidnapper

 and finally they seek peace with other nation peace in a world of unrest the nation know that i hate war and i know that the nation hate war

 i submit to you a record of peace and on that record a well found expectation for future peace peace for the individual peace for the community peace for the nation and peace with the world

 tonight i call the roll the roll of honor of those who stand with we in 1932 and still stand with we today

 write on it be the name of million who never have a chance man at starvation wage woman in sweatshop child at loom

 write on it be the name of those who despair young man and young woman for whom opportunity have become a will o’-the wisp

 write on it be the name of farmer whose acre yield only bitterness business man whose book be portent of disaster home owner who be face with eviction frugal citizen whose saving be insecure

 write there in large letter be the name of countless other americans of all party and all faith americans who have eye to see and heart to understand whose conscience be burden because too many of their fellow be burden who look on these thing four year ago and say this can be change we will change it

 we still lead that army in 1936 they stand with we then because in 1932 they believe they stand with we today because in 1936 they know and with they stand million of new recruit who have come to know

 their hope have become our record

 we have not come this far without a struggle and i assure you we can not go far without a struggle

 for twelve year this nation be afflict with hear nothing see nothing do nothing government the nation look to government but the government look away nine mocking year with the golden calf and three long year of the scourge nine crazy year at the ticker and three long year in the breadline nine mad year of mirage and three long year of despair powerful influence strive today to restore that kind of government with its doctrine that that government be good which be most indifferent

 for nearly four year you have have an administration which instead of twirl its thumb have roll up its sleeve we will keep our sleeve roll up

 we have to struggle with the old enemy of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteer

 they have begin to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affair we know now that government by organized money be just as dangerous as government by organize mob

 never before in all our history have these force be so united against one candidate as they stand today they be unanimous in their hate for i and i welcome their hatred

 i should like to have it say of my first administration that in it the force of selfishness and of lust for power meet their match i should like to have it say of my second administration that in it these force meet their master

 the american people know from a four year record that today there be only one entrance to the white house by the front door since march 4 1933 there have be only one pass key to the white house i have carry that key in my pocket it be there tonight so long as i be president it will remain in my pocket

 those who use to have pass key be not happy some of they be desperate only desperate man with their back to the wall would descend so far below the level of decent citizenship as to foster the current pay envelope campaign against america ’s work people only reckless man heedless of consequence would risk the disruption of the hope for a new peace between worker and employer by return to the tactic of the labor spy

 here be an amazing paradox the very employer and politician and publisher who talk most loudly of class antagonism and the destruction of the american system now undermine that system by this attempt to coerce the vote of the wage earner of this country it be the 1936 version of the old threat to close down the factory or the office if a particular candidate do not win it be an old strategy of tyrant to delude their victim into fight their battle for they

 every message in a pay envelope even if it be the truth be a command to vote accord to the will of the employer but this propaganda be bad it be deceit

 they tell the worker his wage will be reduce by a contribution to some vague form of old age insurance they carefully conceal from he the fact that for every dollar of premium he pay for that insurance the employer pay another dollar that omission be deceit

 they carefully conceal from he the fact that under the federal law he receive another insurance policy to help he if he lose his job and that the premium of that policy be pay 100 percent by the employer and not one cent by the worker they do not tell he that the insurance policy that be buy for he be far more favorable to he than any policy that any private insurance company could afford to issue that omission be deceit

 they imply to he that he pay all the cost of both form of insurance they carefully conceal from he the fact that for every dollar put up by he his employer put up three dollar three for one and that omission be deceit

 but they be guilty of more than deceit when they imply that the reserve thus create against both these policy will be steal by some future congress divert to some wholly foreign purpose they attack the integrity and honor of american government itself those who suggest that be already alien to the spirit of american democracy let they emigrate and try their lot under some foreign flag in which they have more confidence

 the fraudulent nature of this attempt be well show by the record of vote on the passage of the social security act in addition to an overwhelming majority of democrats in both houses seventy seven republican representatives vote for it and only eighteen against it and fifteen republican senators vote for it and only five against it where do this last minute drive of the republican leadership leave these republican representatives and senators who help enact this law

 i be sure the vast majority of law abide businessman who be not party to this propaganda fully appreciate the extent of the threat to honest business contain in this coercion

 i have express indignation at this form of campaigning and i be confident that the overwhelming majority of employer worker and the general public share that indignation and will show it at the poll on tuesday next

 aside from this phase of it i prefer to remember this campaign not as bitter but only as hard fought there should be no bitterness or hate where the sole thought be the welfare of the united states of america no man can occupy the office of president without realize that he be president of all the people

 it be because i have seek to think in term of the whole nation that i be confident that today just as four year ago the people want more than promise

 our vision for the future contain more than promise

 this be our answer to those who silent about their own plan ask we to state our objective

 of course we will continue to seek to improve work condition for the worker of america to reduce hour over long to increase wage that spell starvation to end the labor of child to wipe out sweatshop of course we will continue every effort to end monopoly in business to support collective bargaining to stop unfair competition to abolish dishonorable trade practice for all these we have only just begin to fight

 of course we will continue to work for cheap electricity in the home and on the farm of america for well and cheap transportation for low interest rate for sounder home financing for well banking for the regulation of security issue for reciprocal trade among nation for the wiping out of slum for all these we have only just begin to fight

 of course we will continue our effort in behalf of the farmer of america with their continue cooperation we will do all in our power to end the piling up of huge surplus which spell ruinous price for their crop we will persist in successful action for well land use for reforestation for the conservation of water all the way from its source to the sea for drought and flood control for well marketing facility for farm commodity for a definite reduction of farm tenancy for encouragement of farmer cooperative for crop insurance and a stable food supply for all these we have only just begin to fight

 of course we will provide useful work for the needy unemployed we prefer useful work to the pauperism of a dole

 here and now i want to make myself clear about those who disparage their fellow citizen on the relief roll they say that those on relief be not merely jobless that they be worthless their solution for the relief problem be to end relief to purge the roll by starvation to use the language of the stock broker our needy unemployed would be care for when as and if some fairy godmother should happen on the scene

 you and i will continue to refuse to accept that estimate of our unemployed fellow americans your government be still on the same side of the street with the good samaritan and not with those who pass by on the other side

 again what of our objective

 of course we will continue our effort for young man and woman so that they may obtain an education and an opportunity to put it to use of course we will continue our help for the crippled for the blind for the mother our insurance for the unemployed our security for the aged of course we will continue to protect the consumer against unnecessary price spread against the cost that be add by monopoly and speculation we will continue our successful effort to increase his purchasing power and to keep it constant

 for these thing too and for a multitude of other like they we have only just begin to fight

 all this all these objective spell peace at home all our action all our ideal spell also peace with other nation

 today there be war and rumor of war we want none of it but while we guard our shore against threat of war we will continue to remove the cause of unrest and antagonism at home which might make our people easy victim to those for whom foreign war be profitable you know well that those who stand to profit by war be not on our side in this campaign

 peace on earth good will toward men”—democracy must cling to that message for it be my deep conviction that democracy can not live without that true religion which give a nation a sense of justice and of moral purpose above our political forum above our market place stand the altar of our faith altar on which burn the fire of devotion that maintain all that be good in we and all that be good in our nation

 we have need of that devotion today it be that which make it possible for government to persuade those who be mentally prepared to fight each other to go on instead to work for and to sacrifice for each other that be why we need to say with the prophet what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god that be why the recovery we seek the recovery we be win be more than economic in it be include justice and love and humility not for ourselves as individual alone but for our nation

 that be the road to peace

when four year ago we meet to inaugurate president the republic single minded in anxiety stand in spirit here we dedicate ourselves to the fulfillment of a vision to speed the time when there would be for all the people that security and peace essential to the pursuit of happiness we of the republic pledge ourselves to drive from the temple of our ancient faith those who have profane it to end by action tireless and unafraid the stagnation and despair of that day we do those first thing first
 our covenant with ourselves do not stop there instinctively we recognize a deep need the need to find through government the instrument of our united purpose to solve for the individual the ever rise problem of a complex civilization repeat attempt at their solution without the aid of government have leave we baffle and bewilder for without that aid we have be unable to create those moral control over the service of science which be necessary to make science a useful servant instead of a ruthless master of mankind to do this we know that we must find practical control over blind economic force and blindly selfish man
 we of the republic sense the truth that democratic government have innate capacity to protect its people against disaster once consider inevitable to solve problem once consider unsolvable we would not admit that we could not find a way to master economic epidemic just as after century of fatalistic suffering we have find a way to master epidemic of disease we refuse to leave the problem of our common welfare to be solve by the wind of chance and the hurricane of disaster
 in this we americans be discover no wholly new truth we be write a new chapter in our book of self government
 this year mark the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the constitutional convention which make we a nation at that convention our forefather find the way out of the chaos which follow the revolutionary war they create a strong government with power of united action sufficient then and now to solve problem utterly beyond individual or local solution a century and a half ago they establish the federal government in order to promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to the american people
 today we invoke those same power of government to achieve the same objective
 four year of new experience have not belie our historic instinct they hold out the clear hope that government within community government within the separate states and government of the united states can do the thing the time require without yield its democracy our task in the last four year do not force democracy to take a holiday
 nearly all of we recognize that as intricacy of human relationship increase so power to govern they also must increase power to stop evil power to do good the essential democracy of our nation and the safety of our people depend not upon the absence of power but upon lodge it with those whom the people can change or continue at state interval through an honest and free system of election the constitution of 1787 do not make our democracy impotent
 in fact in these last four year we have make the exercise of all power more democratic for we have begin to bring private autocratic power into their proper subordination to the public 's government the legend that they be invincible above and beyond the process of a democracy have be shatter they have be challenge and beat
 our progress out of the depression be obvious but that be not all that you and i mean by the new order of thing our pledge be not merely to do a patchwork job with second hand material by use the new material of social justice we have undertake to erect on the old foundation a more enduring structure for the well use of future generation
 in that purpose we have be help by achievement of mind and spirit old truth have be relearn untruth have be unlearn we have always know that heedless self interest be bad moral we know now that it be bad economic out of the collapse of a prosperity whose builder boast their practicality have come the conviction that in the long run economic morality pay we be begin to wipe out the line that divide the practical from the ideal and in so do we be fashion an instrument of unimagined power for the establishment of a morally well world
 this new understanding undermine the old admiration of worldly success as such we be begin to abandon our tolerance of the abuse of power by those who betray for profit the elementary decency of life
 in this process evil thing formerly accept will not be so easily condone hard headedness will not so easily excuse hardheartedness we be move toward an era of good feeling but we realize that there can be no era of good feeling save among man of good will
 for these reason i be justify in believe that the great change we have witness have be the change in the moral climate of america
 among man of good will science and democracy together offer an ever rich life and ever large satisfaction to the individual with this change in our moral climate and our rediscovered ability to improve our economic order we have set our foot upon the road of endure progress
 shall we pause now and turn our back upon the road that lie ahead shall we call this the promise land or shall we continue on our way for each age be a dream that be die or one that be come to birth
 many voice be hear as we face a great decision comfort say tarry a while opportunism say this be a good spot timidity ask how difficult be the road ahead
 true we have come far from the day of stagnation and despair vitality have be preserve courage and confidence have be restore mental and moral horizon have be extend
 but our present gain be win under the pressure of more than ordinary circumstance advance become imperative under the goad of fear and suffering the time be on the side of progress
 to hold to progress today however be more difficult dulled conscience irresponsibility and ruthless self interest already reappear such symptom of prosperity may become portent of disaster prosperity already test the persistence of our progressive purpose
 let we ask again have we reach the goal of our vision of that fourth day of march 1933 have we find our happy valley
 i see a great nation upon a great continent bless with a great wealth of natural resource its hundred and thirty million people be at peace among themselves they be make their country a good neighbor among the nation i see a united states which can demonstrate that under democratic method of government national wealth can be translate into a spread volume of human comfort hitherto unknown and the low standard of living can be raise far above the level of mere subsistence
 but here be the challenge to our democracy in this nation i see ten of million of its citizen a substantial part of its whole population who at this very moment be deny the great part of what the very low standard of today call the necessity of life
 i see million of family try to live on income so meager that the pall of family disaster hang over they day by day
 i see million whose daily life in city and on farm continue under condition label indecent by a so call polite society half a century ago
 i see million deny education recreation and the opportunity to better their lot and the lot of their child
 i see million lack the mean to buy the product of farm and factory and by their poverty deny work and productiveness to many other million
 i see one third of a nation ill house ill clothe ill nourish
 it be not in despair that i paint you that picture i paint it for you in hope because the nation see and understand the injustice in it propose to paint it out we be determined to make every american citizen the subject of his country 's interest and concern and we will never regard any faithful law abide group within our border as superfluous the test of our progress be not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it be whether we provide enough for those who have too little
 if i know aught of the spirit and purpose of our nation we will not listen to comfort opportunism and timidity we will carry on
 overwhelmingly we of the republic be man and woman of good will man and woman who have more than warm heart of dedication man and woman who have cool head and willing hand of practical purpose as well they will insist that every agency of popular government use effective instrument to carry out their will
 government be competent when all who compose it work as trustee for the whole people it can make constant progress when it keep abreast of all the fact it can obtain justify support and legitimate criticism when the people receive true information of all that government do
 if i know aught of the will of our people they will demand that these condition of effective government shall be create and maintain they will demand a nation uncorrupted by cancer of injustice and therefore strong among the nation in its example of the will to peace
 today we reconsecrate our country to long cherish ideal in a suddenly change civilization in every land there be always at work force that drive man apart and force that draw man together in our personal ambition we be individualist but in our seeking for economic and political progress as a nation we all go up or else we all go down as one people
 to maintain a democracy of effort require a vast amount of patience in deal with differ method a vast amount of humility but out of the confusion of many voice rise an understanding of dominant public need then political leadership can voice common ideal and aid in their realization
 in take again the oath of office as president of the united states i assume the solemn obligation of lead the american people forward along the road over which they have choose to advance
 while this duty rest upon i i shall do my utmost to speak their purpose and to do their will seek divine guidance to help we each and every one to give light to they that sit in darkness and to guide our foot into the way of peace

last thursday i describe in detail certain economic problem which everyone admit now face the nation for the many message which have come to i after that speech and which it be physically impossible to answer individually i take this mean of say thank you
 tonight sit at my desk in the white house i make my first radio report to the people in my second term of office
 i be remind of that evening in march four year ago when i make my first radio report to you we be then in the midst of the great banking crisis
 soon after with the authority of the congress we ask the nation to turn over all of its privately hold gold dollar for dollar to the government of the united states
 today 's recovery prove how right that policy be
 but when almost two year later it come before the supreme court its constitutionality be uphold only by a five to four vote the change of one vote would have throw all the affair of this great nation back into hopeless chaos in effect four justice rule that the right under a private contract to exact a pound of flesh be more sacred than the main objective of the constitution to establish an enduring nation
 in 1933 you and i know that we must never let our economic system get completely out of joint again that we could not afford to take the risk of another great depression
 we also become convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark day be to have a government with power to prevent and to cure the abuse and the inequality which have throw that system out of joint
 we then begin a program of remedy those abuse and inequality to give balance and stability to our economic system to make it bomb proof against the cause of 1929
 today we be only part way through that program and recovery be speed up to a point where the danger of 1929 be again become possible not this week or month perhaps but within a year or two
 national law be need to complete that program individual or local or state effort alone can not protect we in 1937 any well than ten year ago
 it will take time and plenty of time to work out our remedy administratively even after legislation be pass to complete our program of protection in time therefore we can not delay one moment in make certain that our national government have power to carry through
 four year ago action do not come until the eleventh hour it be almost too late
 if we learn anything from the depression we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circle of futile discussion and debate always postpone the day of decision
 the american people have learn from the depression for in the last three national election an overwhelming majority of they vote a mandate that the congress and the president begin the task of provide that protection not after long year of debate but now
 the courts however have cast doubt on the ability of the elect congress to protect we against catastrophe by meet squarely our modern social and economic condition
 we be at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection it be a quiet crisis there be no line of depositor outside close bank but to the far sighted it be far reach in its possibility of injury to america
 i want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis the need to meet the unanswered challenge of one third of a nation ill nourish ill clothe ill house
 last thursday i describe the american form of government as a three horse team provide by the constitution to the american people so that their field might be plow the three horse be of course the three branch of government the congress the executive and the courts two of the horse be pull in unison today the third be not those who have intimate that the president of the united states be try to drive that team overlook the simple fact that the president as chief executive be himself one of the three horse
 it be the american people themselves who be in the driver 's seat
 it be the american people themselves who want the furrow plow
 it be the american people themselves who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other two
 i hope that you have re read the constitution of the united states in these past few week like the bible it ought to be read again and again
 it be an easy document to understand when you remember that it be call into be because the articles of confederation under which the original thirteen state try to operate after the revolution show the need of a national government with power enough to handle national problem in its preamble the constitution state that it be intend to form a more perfect union and promote the general welfare and the power give to the congress to carry out those purpose can be well describe by say that they be all the power need to meet each and every problem which then have a national character and which could not be meet by merely local action
 but the framer go far have in mind that in succeed generation many other problem then undreame of would become national problem they give to the congress the ample broad power to levy taxis and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states
 that my friend be what i honestly believe to have be the clear and underlying purpose of the patriot who write a federal constitution to create a national government with national power intend as they say to form a more perfect union for ourselves and our posterity
 for nearly twenty year there be no conflict between the congress and the court then congress pass a statute which in 1803 the court say violate an express provision of the constitution the court claim the power to declare it unconstitutional and do so declare it but a little later the court itself admit that it be an extraordinary power to exercise and through mr. justice washington lay down this limitation upon it it be but a decent respect due to the wisdom the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body by which any law be pass to presume in favor of its validity until its violation of the constitution be prove beyond all reasonable doubt
 but since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation the court have more and more often and more and more boldly assert a power to veto law pass by the congress and state legislatures in complete disregard of this original limitation
 in the last four year the sound rule of give statute the benefit of all reasonable doubt have be cast aside the court have be act not as a judicial body but as a policy make body
 when the congress have seek to stabilize national agriculture to improve the condition of labor to safeguard business against unfair competition to protect our national resource and in many other way to serve our clearly national need the majority of the court have be assume the power to pass on the wisdom of these act of the congress and to approve or disapprove the public policy write into these law
 that be not only my accusation it be the accusation of most distinguished justice of the present supreme court i have not the time to quote to you all the language use by dissent justice in many of these case but in the case hold the railroad retirement act unconstitutional for instance chief justice hughes say in a dissent opinion that the majority opinion be a departure from sound principle and place an unwarranted limitation upon the commerce clause and three other justice agree with he
 in the case of hold the aaa unconstitutional justice stone say of the majority opinion that it be a torture construction of the constitution and two other justice agree with he
 in the case hold the new york minimum wage law unconstitutional justice stone say that the majority be actually read into the constitution their own personal economic predilection and that if the legislative power be not leave free to choose the method of solve the problem of poverty subsistence and health of large number in the community then government be to be render impotent and two other justice agree with he
 in the face of these dissent opinion there be no basis for the claim make by some member of the court that something in the constitution have compel they regretfully to thwart the will of the people
 in the face of such dissent opinion it be perfectly clear that as chief justice hughes have say we be under a constitution but the constitution be what the judge say it be
 the court in addition to the proper use of its judicial function have improperly set itself up as a third house of the congress a super legislature as one of the justice have call it read into the constitution word and implication which be not there and which be never intend to be there
 we have therefore reach the point as a nation where we must take action to save the constitution from the court and the court from itself we must find a way to take an appeal from the supreme court to the constitution itself we want a supreme court which will do justice under the constitution and not over it in our court we want a government of law and not of man
 i want as all americans want an independent judiciary as propose by the framer of the constitution that mean a supreme court that will enforce the constitution as write that will refuse to amend the constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power in other word by judicial say so it do not mean a judiciary so independent that it can deny the existence of fact which be universally recognize
 how then could we proceed to perform the mandate give we it be say in last year 's democratic platform if these problem can not be effectively solve within the constitution we shall seek such clarify amendment as will assure the power to enact those law adequately to regulate commerce protect public health and safety and safeguard economic security in other word we say we would seek an amendment only if every other possible mean by legislation be to fail
 when i commence to review the situation with the problem squarely before i i come by a process of elimination to the conclusion that short of amendment the only method which be clearly constitutional and would at the same time carry out other much need reform be to infuse new blood into all our courts we must have man worthy and equip to carry out impartial justice but at the same time we must have judges who will bring to the courts a present day sense of the constitution judges who will retain in the courts the judicial function of a court and reject the legislative power which the court have today assume
 in forty five out of the forty eight state of the union judges be choose not for life but for a period of year in many state judges must retire at the age of seventy congress have provide financial security by offer life pension at full pay for federal judges on all court who be willing to retire at seventy in the case of supreme court justices that pension be $ 20,000 a year but all federal judges once appoint can if they choose hold office for life no matter how old they may get to be
 what be my proposal it be simply this whenever a judge or justice of any federal court have reach the age of seventy and do not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension a new member shall be appoint by the president then in office with the approval as require by the constitution of the senate of the united states
 that plan have two chief purpose by bring into the judicial system a steady and continue stream of new and young blood i hope first to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and therefore less costly secondly to bring to the decision of social and economic problem young man who have have personal experience and contact with modern fact and circumstance under which average man have to live and work this plan will save our national constitution from harden of the judicial artery
 the number of judges to be appoint would depend wholly on the decision of present judge now over seventy or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy
 if for instance any one of the six justices of the supreme court now over the age of seventy should retire as provide under the plan no additional place would be create consequently although there never can be more than fifteen there may be only fourteen or thirteen or twelve and there may be only nine
 there be nothing novel or radical about this idea it seek to maintain the federal bench in full vigor it have be discuss and approve by many person of high authority ever since a similar proposal pass the house of representatives in 1869
 why be the age fix at seventy because the law of many states the practice of the civil service the regulation of the army and navy and the rule of many of our universities and of almost every great private business enterprise commonly fix the retirement age at seventy year or less
 the statute would apply to all the court in the federal system there be general approval so far as the low federal court be concern the plan have meet opposition only so far as the supreme court of the united states itself be concern if such a plan be good for the low court it certainly ought to be equally good for the high court from which there be no appeal
 those oppose this plan have seek to arouse prejudice and fear by cry that i be seek to pack the supreme court and that a baneful precedent will be establish
 what do they mean by the word pack the court
 let i answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of my purpose
 if by that phrase pack the court it be charge that i wish to place on the bench spineless puppet who would disregard the law and would decide specific case as i wish they to be decide i make this answer that no president fit for his office would appoint and no senate of honorable man fit for their office would confirm that kind of appointee to the supreme court but if by that phrase the charge be make that i would appoint and the senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present member of the court who understand those modern condition that i will appoint justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the congress on legislative policy that i will appoint justices who will act as justices and not as legislator if the appointment of such justices can be call pack the courts then i say that i and with i the vast majority of the american people favor do just that thing- now
 be it a dangerous precedent for the congress to change the number of the justices the congress have always have and will have that power the number of justice have be change several time before in the administration of john adams and thomas jefferson both signer of the declaration of independence andrew jackson abraham lincoln and ulysses s. grant
 i suggest only the addition of justices to the bench in accordance with a clearly define principle relate to a clearly define age limit fundamentally if in the future america can not trust the congress it elect to refrain from abuse of our constitutional usage democracy will have fail far beyond the importance to it of any king of precedent concern the judiciary
 we think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by offer they a life pension at full salary why then should we leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual justice
 it be the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and young blood into the judiciary normally every president appoint a large number of district and circuit court judges and a few member of the supreme court until my first term practically every president of the united states have appoint at least one member of the supreme court president taft appoint five member and name a chief justice president wilson three president harding four include a chief justice president coolidge one president hoover three include a chief justice
 such a succession of appointment should have provide a court well balanced as to age but chance and the disinclination of individual to leave the supreme bench have now give we a court in which five justices will be over seventy five year of age before next june and one over seventy thus a sound public policy have be defeat
 i now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any such ill balanced court in the future i propose that hereafter when a judge reach the age of seventy a new and young judge shall be add to the court automatically in this way i propose to enforce a sound public policy by law instead of leave the composition of our federal courts include the high to be determine by chance or the personal indecision of individual
 if such a law as i propose be regard as establish a new precedent be it not a most desirable precedent
 like all lawyer like all americans i regret the necessity of this controversy but the welfare of the united states and indeed of the constitution itself be what we all must think about first our difficulty with the court today rise not from the court as an institution but from human being within it but we can not yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgement of a few man who be fearful of the future would deny we the necessary mean of deal with the present
 this plan of mine be no attack on the court it seek to restore the court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional government and to have it resume its high task of build anew on the constitution a system of living law the court itself can well undo what the court have do
 i have thus explain to you the reason that lie behind our effort to secure result by legislation within the constitution i hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be render unnecessary but let we examine the process
 there be many type of amendment propose each one be radically different from the other there be no substantial group within the congress or outside it who be agree on any single amendment
 it would take month or year to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment it would take month and year thereafter to get a two third majority in favor of that amendment in both houses of the congress
 then would come the long course of ratification by three fourth of all the states no amendment which any powerful economic interest or the leader of any powerful political party have have reason to oppose have ever be ratify within anything like a reasonable time and thirteen state which contain only five percent of the vote population can block ratification even though the thirty five states with ninety five percent of the population be in favor of it
 a very large percentage of newspaper publisher chambers of commerce bar association manufacturers associations who be try to give the impression that they really do want a constitutional amendment would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment be propose oh i be for an amendment all right but this amendment you propose be not the kind of amendment that i be think about i be therefore go to spend my time my effort and my money to block the amendment although i would be awfully glad to help get some other kind od amendment ratify
 two group oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a constitutional amendment the first include those who fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along modern line this be the same group who during the campaign last fall try to block the mandate of the people
 now they be make a last stand and the strategy of that last stand be to suggest the time consume process of amendment in order to kill off by delay the legislation demand by the mandate
 to they i say i do not think you will be able long to fool the american people as to your purpose
 the other group be compose of those who honestly believe the amendment process be the good and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if they could agree on one
 to they i say we can not rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to our present difficulty when the time come for action you will find that many of those who pretend to support you will sabotage any constructive amendment which be propose look at these strange bed fellow of your when before have you find they really at your side in your fight for progress
 and remember one thing more even if an amendment be pass and even if in the year to come it be to be ratify its meaning would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sit on the supreme court bench an amendment like the rest of the constitution be what the justices say it be rather than what its framer or you might hope it be
 this proposal of mine will not infringe in the slight upon the civil or religious liberty so dear to every american
 my record as governor and president prove my devotion to those liberty you who know i can have no fear that i would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our heritage of freedom
 the present attempt by those oppose to progress to play upon the fear of danger to personal liberty bring again to mind that crude and cruel strategy try by the same opposition to frighten the worker of america in a pay envelope propaganda against the social security law the worker be not fool by that propaganda then the people of america will not be fool by such propaganda now
 i be in favor of action through legislation
 first because i believe that it can be pass at this session of the congress
 second because it will provide a reinvigorated liberal minded judiciary necessary to furnish quick and cheap justice from bottom to top
 third because it will provide a series of federal courts willing to enforce the constitution as write and unwilling to assert legislative power by write into it their own political and economic policy
 during the past half century the balance of power between the three great branch of the federal government have be tip out of balance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purpose of the framer of the constitution it be my purpose to restore that balance you who know i will accept my solemn assurance that in a world in which democracy be under attack i seek to make american democracy succeed you and i will do our part

i be glad to come once again to chicago and especially to have the opportunity of take part in the dedication of this important project of civic betterment
 on my trip across the continent and back i have be show many evidence of the result of common sense cooperation between municipality and the federal government and i have be greet by ten of thousand of americans who have tell i in every look and word that their material and spiritual well being have make great stride forward in the past few year
 and yet as i have see with my own eye the prosperous farm the thrive factory and the busy railroad as i have see the happiness and security and peace which cover our wide land almost inevitably i have be compel to contrast our peace with very different scene be enact in other part of the world
 it be because the people of the united states under modern condition must for the sake of their own future give thought to the rest of the world that i as the responsible executive head of the nation have choose this great inland city and this gala occasion to speak to you on a subject of definite national importance
 the political situation in the world which of late have be grow progressively bad be such as to cause grave concern and anxiety to all the people and nation who wish to live in peace and amity with their neighbor
 some fifteen year ago the hope of mankind for a continue era of international peace be raise to great height when more than sixty nation solemnly pledge themselves not to resort to arm in furtherance of their national aim and policy the high aspiration express in the briand kellogg peace pact and the hope for peace thus raise have of late give way to a haunt fear of calamity the present reign of terror and international lawlessness begin a few year ago
 it begin through unjustified interference in the internal affair of other nation or the invasion of alien territory in violation of treaty and have now reach a stage where the very foundation of civilization be seriously threaten the landmark and tradition which have mark the progress of civilization toward a condition of law order and justice be be wipe away
 without a declaration of war and without warning or justification of any kind civilian include vast number of woman and child be be ruthlessly murder with bomb from the air in time of so call peace ship be be attack and sink by submarine without cause or notice nation be foment and take side in civil warfare in nation that have never do they any harm nation claim freedom for themselves deny it to other
 innocent people innocent nation be be cruelly sacrifice to a greed for power and supremacy which be devoid of all sense of justice and humane consideration
 to paraphrase a recent author perhaps we foresee a time when man exultant in the technique of homicide will rage so hotly over the world that every precious thing will be in danger every book and picture and harmony every treasure garner through two millennium the small the delicate the defenseless all will be lose or wreck or utterly destroy
 if those thing come to pass in other part of the world let no one imagine that america will escape that america may expect mercy that this western hemisphere will not be attack and that it will continue tranquilly and peacefully to carry on the ethic and the art of civilization
 if those day come there will be no safety by arm no help from authority no answer in science the storm will rage till every flower of culture be trample and all human being be level in a vast chaos
 if those day be not to come to pass if we be to have a world in which we can breathe freely and live in amity without fear the peace love nation must make a concerted effort to uphold law and principle on which alone peace can rest secure
 the peace love nation must make a concerted effort in opposition to those violation of treaty and those ignoring of humane instinct which today be create a state of international anarchy and instability from which there be no escape through mere isolation or neutrality
 those who cherish their freedom and recognize and respect the equal right of their neighbor to be free and live in peace must work together for the triumph of law and moral principle in order that peace justice and confidence may prevail in the world there must be a return to a belief in the pledge word in the value of a sign treaty there must be recognition of the fact that national morality be as vital as private morality
 a bishop write i the other day it seem to i that something greatly need to be say in behalf of ordinary humanity against the present practice of carry the horror of war to helpless civilian especially woman and child it may be that such a protest might be regard by many who claim to be realist as futile but may it not be that the heart of mankind be so fill with horror at the present needless suffer that that force could be mobilize in sufficient volume to lessen such cruelty in the day ahead even though it may take twenty year which god forbid for civilization to make effective its corporate protest against this barbarism surely strong voice may hasten the day
 there be a solidarity and interdependence about the modern world both technically and morally which make it impossible for any nation completely to isolate itself from economic and political upheaval in the rest of the world especially when such upheaval appear to be spread and not decline there can be no stability or peace either within nation or between nation except under law and moral standard adhere to by all international anarchy destroy every foundation for peace it jeopardize either the immediate or the future security of every nation large or small it be therefore a matter of vital interest and concern to the people of the united states that the sanctity of international treaty and the maintenance of international morality be restore
 the overwhelming majority of the people and nation of the world today want to live in peace they seek the removal of barrier against trade they want to exert themselves in industry in agriculture and in business that they may increase their wealth through the production of wealth produce good rather than strive to produce military plane and bomb and machine gun and cannon for the destruction of human life and useful property
 in those nation of the world which seem to be pile armament on armament for purpose of aggression and those other nation which fear act of aggression against they and their security a very high proportion of their national income be be spend directly for armament it run from thirty to as high as fifty percent we be fortunate the proportion that we in the united states spend be far less- eleven or twelve percent
 how happy we be that the circumstance of the moment permit we to put our money into bridge and boulevard dam and reforestation the conservation of our soil and many other kind of useful work rather than into huge standing army and vast supply of implement of war
 i be compel and you be compel nevertheless to look ahead the peace the freedom and the security of ninety percent of the population of the world be be jeopardize by the remain ten percent who be threaten a breakdown of all international order and law surely the ninety percent who want to live in peace under law and in accordance with moral standard that have receive almost universal acceptance through the century can and must find some way to make their will prevail
 the situation be definitely of universal concern the question involve relate not merely to violation of specific provision of particular treaty they be question of war and of peace of international law and
 especially of principle of humanity it be true that they involve definite
 violation of agreement and especially of the covenant of the league of
 nations the briand kellogg pact and the nine power treaty but they also
 involve problem of world economy world security and world humanity
 it be true that the moral consciousness of the world must recognize the importance of remove injustice and well found grievance but at the same time it must be arouse to the cardinal necessity of honor sanctity of treaty of respect the right and liberty of other and of put an end to act of international aggression
 it seem to be unfortunately true that the epidemic of world lawlessness be spread
 when an epidemic of physical disease start to spread the community approve and join in a quarantine of the patient in order to protect the health of the community against the spread of the disease
 it be my determination to pursue a policy of peace it be my determination to adopt every practicable measure to avoid involvement in war it ought to be inconceivable that in this modern era and in the face of experience any nation could be so foolish and ruthless as to run the risk of plunge the whole world into war by invade and violating in contravention of solemn treaty the territory of other nation that have do they no real harm and be too weak to protect themselves adequately yet the peace of the world and the welfare and security of every nation include our own be today be threaten by that very thing
 no nation which refuse to exercise forbearance and to respect the freedom and right of other can long remain strong and retain the confidence and respect of other nation no nation ever lose its dignity or its good standing by conciliate its difference and by exercise great patience with and consideration for the right of other nation
 war be a contagion whether it be declare or undeclared it can engulf state and people remote from the original scene of hostility we be determined to keep out of war yet we can not insure ourselves against the disastrous effect of war and the danger of involvement we be adopt such measure as will minimize our risk of involvement but we can not have complete protection in a world of disorder in which confidence and security have break down
 if civilization be to survive the principle of the prince of peace must be restore trust between nation must be revive
 most important of all the will for peace on the part of peace love nation must express itself to the end that nation that may be tempt to violate their agreement and the right of other will desist from such a course there must be positive endeavor to preserve peace
 america hate war america hope for peace therefore america actively engage in the search for peace

this afternoon i have issue a proclamation call a special session of the congress to convene on monday november 15 1937
 i do this in order to give to the congress an opportunity to consider important legislation before the regular session in january and to enable the congress to avoid a lengthy session next year extend through the summer
 i know that many enemy of democracy will say that it be bad for business bad for the tranquility of the country to have a special session even one begin only six week before the regular session but i have never have sympathy with the point of view that a session of the congress be an unfortunate intrusion of what they call politic into our national affair those who do not like democracy want to keep legislator at home but the congress be an essential instrument of democratic government and democratic government can never be consider an intruder into the affair of a democratic nation
 i shall ask this special session to consider immediately certain important legislation which my recent trip through the nation convince i the american people immediately need this do not mean that other legislation to which i be not refer tonight be not an important for part of our national well being but other legislation can be more readily discuss at the regular session
 anyone charge with propose or judge national policy should have first hand knowledge of the nation as a whole
 that be why again this year i have take trip to all part of the country last spring i visit the southwest this summer i make several trip in the east now i be just back from a trip from a trip all the way across the continent and later this autumn i hope to pay my annual visit to the southeast
 for a president especially it be a duty to think in national term
 he must think not only of this year but of future year when someone else will be president
 he must look beyond the average of the prosperity and well being of the country for because average easily cover up danger spot of poverty and instability
 he must not let the country be deceive by a merely temporary prosperity which depend on wasteful exploitation of resource which can not last
 he must think not only of keep we out of war today but also of keep we out of war in generation to come
 the kind of prosperity we want be the sound and permanent kind which be not build up temporarily at the expense of any a section or any group and the kind of peace we want be the sound and permanent kind which be build on the cooperative search for peace by all the nation which want peace
 the other day i be ask to state my outstanding impression gain on this recent trip to the pacific coast and back and i say that it seem to i to be the general understanding on the part of the average citizen understanding of the broad objective and policy which i have just outline
 five year of fierce discussion and debate five year of information through the radio and the move picture have take the whole nation to school in the nation 's business even those who have most attack our objective have by their very criticism encourage the mass of our citizen to think about and understand the issue involve and understanding to approve
 out of that process we have learn to think as a nation and out of that process we have learn to feel ourselves a nation as never before in our history each section of america say to every other section thy people shall be my people
 for most of the country this have be a good year well in dollar and cent than for many year far well in the soundness of its prosperity and everywhere i go i find particular optimism about the good effect on business which be expect from the steady spending by farmer of the large farm income in many year
 but we have not yet do all that must be do to make this prosperity stable the people of the united states be check in their effort to prevent future pile up of huge agricultural surplus and the tumble price which inevitably follow they they be check in their effort to secure reasonable minimum wage and maximum hour and the end of child labor and because they be check many group in many part of the country still have less purchasing power and a low standard of living than the nation as a whole can permanently allow
 americans realize these fact that be why they ask government not to stop overne simply because prosperity have come back a long way
 they do not look on government as an interloper in their affair on the contrary they regard it as the most effective form of organized self help
 sometimes i get bored sit in washington hear certain people talk and talk about all that government ought not to do people who get all they want from government back in the day when the financial institution and the railroad be be bail out in 1933 bail out by the government it be refreshing to go out through the country and feel the common wisdom that the time to repair the roof be when the sun be shine
 they want the financial budget balance but they want the human budget balance as well they want to set up a national economy which balance itself with as little government subsidy as possible for they realize that persistent subsidy ultimately bankrupt their government
 they be less concerned that every detail be immediately right than they be that the direction be right they know that just so long as we be travel on the right road it do not make much difference if occasionally we hit a thank you marm
 the overwhelming majority of our citizen who live by agriculture be think very clearly how they want government to help they in connection with the production of crop they want government help in two way first in the control of surplus and second in the proper use of land
 the other day a reporter tell i that he have never be able to understand why the government seek to curtail crop production and at the same time to open up new irrigated acre
 he be confuse two totally separate objective
 crop surplus control relate to the total amount of any major crop grow in the whole nation on all cultivate land good or bad good land or poor land control by the cooperation of the crop grower and with the help of the government land use on the other hand be a policy of provide each farmer with the good quality and type of land we have or can make available for his part in that total production add good new land for diversified crop be offset by abandon poor land now uneconomically farm
 the total amount of production largely determine the price of the crop and therefore the difference between comfort and misery for the farmer
 let i give you an example if we americans be foolish enough to run every shoe factory twenty four hour a day seven day a week we would soon have more shoe than the nation could possibly buy a surplus of shoe so great that it would have to be destroy or give away or sell at price far below the cost of production that simple law illustration that simple law of supply and demand equally affect the price of all our major crop
 you and i have hear big manufacturer talk about control of production by the farmer as an indefensible economy of scarcity as they call it and yet these same manufacturer never hesitate to shut down their own huge plant throw man out of work and cut down the purchase power of the whole community community whenever they think that they must adjust their production to an oversupply of the good they make when it be their baby who have the measle they call it not an economy of scarcity but sound business judgment
 of course speak seriously what you and i want be such governmental rule of the game that labor and agriculture and industry will all produce a balanced abundance without waste
 so we intend this winter to find a way to prevent four and a half cent cotton and nine cent corn and thirty cent wheat with all the disaster those price mean for all of we to prevent those price from ever come back again to do that the farmer themselves want to cooperate to build an all weather farm program so that in the long run price will be more stable they believe this can be do and the national budget keep out of the red
 and when we have find that way to protect the farmer price from the effect of alternate crop surplus and crop scarcity we shall also have find the way to protect the nation 's food supply from the effect of the same fluctuation we ought always to have enough food at price within the reach of the consume public for the consumer in the city of america we must find a way to help the farmer to store up in year of plenty enough to avoid hardship in the year of scarcity
 our land use policy be a different thing i have just visit much of the work that the national government be do to stop soil erosion to save our forest to prevent flood to produce electric power for more general use and to give people a chance to move from poor land on to well land by irrigate thousand of acre that need only water to provide an opportunity to make a good living
 i see bare and burn hillside where only a few year ago great forest be grow they be now be plant to young tree not only to stop erosion but to provide a lumber supply for the future
 i see ccc boy and wpa worker build check dam and small pond and terrace to raise the water table and make it possible for farm and village to remain in safety where they now be i see the harnessing of the turbulent missouri a muddy stream with the topsoil of many state and i see barge on new channel carry produce and freight athwart the nation
 let i give you two simple illustration of why government project of this type have a national importance for the whole country and not merely a local importance
 in the boise valley in idaho i see a district which have be recently irrigate to enormous fertility so that a family can now make a pretty good living from forty acre of its land many of the family who be make good in that valley today move there from a thousand mile away they come from the dust strip that run through the middle of the nation all the way from the canadian border to mexico texas a strip which include large portion of ten state that valley in western idaho therefore assume at once a national importance as a second chance for willing farmer and year by year we propose to add more valley to take care of thousand of other family who need the same kind of second chance in new green pasture
 the other illustration be at the grand coulee dam in the state of washington the engineer in charge tell i that almost half of the whole cost of that dam to date have be spend for material that be manufacture east of the mississippi river give employment and wage to thousand of industrial worker in the eastern third of the nation two thousand mile away
 all of this work need of course a more business like system of planning and a great foresight than we use today
 and that be why i recommend to the last session of the congress the creation of seven planning region in which local people will originate and coordinate recommendation as to the kind of this work of this kind to be do in their particular region the congress will of course will determine the project to be select within the budget limit
 to carry out any twentieth century program we must give the executive branch of the government twentieth century machinery to work with i recognize that democratic process be necessarily and i think rightly slow than dictatorial process but i refuse to believe that democratic process need be dangerously slow
 for many year we have all know that the executive and administrative department of the government in washington be a higgledy piggledy patchwork of duplicate responsibility and overlap power the reorganization of this vast government machinery which i propose to the congress last winter do not conflict with the principle of the democratic process as some people say it only make that process work more efficiently
 on my recent trip many people have talk to i about the million of man and woman and child who still work at insufficient wage and overlong hour
 american industry have search the outside world to find new market but it can create on its very doorstep the big and most permanent market it have ever have see it need the reduction of trade barrier to improve its foreign market but it should not overlook the chance to reduce the domestic trade barrier right here right away without wait for any treaty a few more dollar a week in wage a well distribution of job with a short work day will almost overnight make million of our lowest pay worker actual buyer of billion of dollar of industrial and farm product that increase volume of sale ought to lessen other cost of production so much that even a considerable increase in labor cost can be absorb without impose high price on the consumer
 i be a firm believer in fully adequate pay for all labor but right now i be most greatly concerned in increase the pay of the lowest pay labor those who be our most numerous consume group but who today do not make enough to maintain a decent standard of living or to buy the food and the clothe and the other article necessary to keep our factory and farm fully run
 i think that farsighte businessman already understand and agree with this policy they agree also that no one section of the country can permanently benefit itself or the rest of the country by maintain standard of wage and hour far that be far inferior to other section of the country
 most businessman big and little know that their government neither want to put they out of business nor to prevent they from earn a decent profit in spite of the alarm of a few who seek to regain control of over american life most businessman big and little know that their government be try to make property more secure than ever before by give every family a real chance to have a property stake in the nation
 whatever danger there may be to the property and profit of the many if there be any danger come not from government 's attitude toward business but from restraint now impose upon business by private monopoly and financial oligarchy the average businessman know that a high cost of living be a great deterrent to business and that business prosperity depend much upon a low price policy which encourage the wide possible consumption as one of the country 's lead economist recently say the continuance of business recovery in the united states depend far more up)on business policy business pricing policy than it do on anything that may be do or not do in washington
 our competitive system be of course not altogether competitive anybody who buy any large quantity of manufacture good know this whether it be the government or an individual buyer we have anti trust law to be sure but they have not be adequate to check the growth of many monopoly whether or not they might have be adequate originally adequate interpretation by the court and the difficulty and delay of legal procedure have now definitely limit their effectiveness
 we be already study how to strengthen our anti trust law in order to end monopoly not to hurt but to free legitimate business of the nation
 i have touch briefly on these important subject which take together make a program for the immediate future and i know you will realize that to attain it legislation be necessary
 as we plan today for the creation of ever high standard of live for the people of the united states we be aware that our plan may be most seriously affect by event in the world outside our border
 by a series of trade agreement we have be attempt to recreate the trade of the world which that trade of the world that play so important a part in our domestic prosperity but we know that if the world outside our border fall into the chaos of war world trade will be completely disrupt
 nor can we view with indifference the destruction of civilized value throughout the world we seek peace not only for our generation but also for the generation of our child
 we seek for they our child the continuance of world civilization in order that their american civilization may continue to be invigorate help by the achievement of civilized man and woman in all the rest of the world
 i want our great democracy to be wise enough to realize that aloofness from war be not promote by unawareness of war in a world of mutual suspicion peace must be affirmatively reach for it can not just be wish for and it can not just be wait for
 we have now make known our willingness to attend a conference of the party to the nine power treaty of 1922 the treaty of washington of which we be one of the original signatory the purpose of this conference will be to seek by agreement a solution of the present situation in china in effort to find that solution it be our purpose to cooperate with the other signatory to this treaty include china and japan
 such cooperation would be an example of one of the possible path to follow in our search for mean toward peace throughout the whole world
 the development of civilization and of human welfare be base on the acceptance by individual of certain fundamental decency in their relation with each other and equally the development of peace in the world be dependent similarly on the acceptance by nation of certain fundamental decency in their relation with each other
 ultimately i hope each nation will accept the fact that violation of these rule of conduct be an injury to the well being of all nation
 meanwhile remember that from 1913 to 1921 i personally be fairly close to world event and in that period while i learn much of what to do i also learn much of what not to do
 the common sense the intelligence of the people of america agree with my statement that america hate war america hope for peace therefore america actively engage in the search for peace

i be appeal to the people of america tonight to help in carry out a task that be important to they and to their government

 it be a part but an essential part of the great task of find job for willing worker who be idle through no fault of their own of find more work for those who be insufficiently employ and of survey the need of worker and industry to see if we can find the basis of a well long range plan of re employment than we have now

 enforce idleness embrace any considerable portion of our people in a nation of such wealth and natural opportunity be a paradox that challenge our ingenuity unemployment be one of the bitter and gall problem that now afflict man kind it have be with we in a measure since the beginning of our industrial era it have be increase by the complexity of business and industry and it have be make more acute by the depression it have make necessary the expenditure of billion of dollar for relief and for publicly create work it have delay the balancing of our national budget and increase the tax burden of all our people in addition to the problem face by the national government our state and local government have be sorely press to meet the increase load result from unemployment

 it be a problem of every civilized nation not ours alone it have be solve in some country by start huge armament program but we americans do not want to solve it that way

 nevertheless as a nation we adopt the policy that no unemployed man or woman can be permit to starve for lack of aid that be still our policy but the situation call for a permanent cure and not just a temporary one

 unemployment relief be of course not the permanent cure the permanent cure lie in find suitable job in industry and agriculture for all willing worker it involve cooperative effort and planning which will lead to the absorption of this unused man power in private industry such planning call for fact which we do not now possess

 such planning apply not only to worker but to the employer in industry because it involve try to get rid of what we call the peak and valley of employment and unemployment try with the help of industry to plan against produce more good one year than people can or will consume and cut production drastically the follow year with the result lay off of hundred of thousand of worker
 that be a long and difficult problem to find the answer to and it may take many effort in the come year to find the right answer but in the meantime we need more fact

 for several year vary estimate of the extent of unemployment have be make valuable as some of these estimate have be in provide we an approximation of the extent of unemployment they have not provide we with sufficient factual datum on which to base a comprehensive re employment program during this coming week we be go to strive to get such fact we be go to conduct a nation wide census of the unemployed and the partly unemployed and we be go to conduct it in the genuinely democratic american way

 this be to be a wholly voluntary census we be go to hold the mirror up to ourselves and try to get not only a true and honest reflection of our present unemployment condition but fact which will help we to plan constructively for the future

 only in a nation whose people be alert to their own self interest and alive to their responsibility of citizenship could such a voluntary plan succeed i be confident that this great american undertaking will succeed every effort be be put forth to make all of our people understand and appreciate its significance and i be sure you will all give it your helpful aid as you have in previous effort aim at national improvement and through which our people have show their capacity for self government

 on tuesday next november 16 the post office department through its far flung and highly efficient organization will undertake to deliver to every abode in the united states an unemployment report card contain 14 simple question

 the report card which the postman will leave at your door on tuesday be a double post card large than the customary card it be address especially to those who be unemployed or partly unemployed and who be able to work and be seek work this card contain a message to you from i carry the assurance that if you will give i all the fact it will help we in planning for the benefit of those who need and want work and do not now have it this message call upon the unemployed and everyone else in this land to help make this census complete honest and accurate

 if all unemployed and partly unemployed person who be able to work and who be seek work will conscientiously fill out these card and mail they just as they be without stamp or envelope by or before midnight november 20 our nation will have real fact upon which to base a sound re employment program

 it be important for every unemployed person to understand that this report card be not an application for relief nor registration for a job this be purely and simply a fact seek census when you receive this card you will note that the 14 question be design to give this nation a wide basis of knowledge of its unemployment condition than it have heretofore have

 if our unemployed and partly unemployed wholeheartedly give the information seek in these 14 question we will know not only the extent of unemployment and partial unemployment but we will know the geographical location of unemployment by state and community we will likewise be able to tell what age group be most severely affect but most important of all we will know the work qualification of the unemployed we will know in what industry they be suit to function and we will be equip to determine what future industrial trend be most likely to absorb these idle worker

 i think it be necessary to emphasize that only those unemployed or partly unemployed who be able to work and who be seek work should fill out these card all other may disregard they

 but i appeal to all of you who be employ today to enlist as good neighbor to those who be unemployed in your community and who may need help in fill out their card properly and promptly they may need the stimulus of your cooperation to recognize the importance of this national effort to help they

 i think this neighborly cooperation will be very helpful in dispelling from the mind of the unemployed all fear that the information seek in this census be to be use for any purpose other than helpfulness i repeat the assurance to the unemployed that the information which you give on these report card will in no sense be use against you but so far as lie within my power will be employ for your own good and for the welfare of the nation

 when we have ascertain the full fact of unemployment we can extend the voluntary and neighborly character of this effort to the task of find the solution to the perplexing problem its importance justify a national approach free from prejudice or partisanship and warrant the cooperative endeavor of business of labor of agriculture and of government

 i be confident that this nation of our have the genius to reorder its affair and possess the physical resource to make it possible for everyone young or old to enjoy the opportunity to work and earn there be neither logic nor necessity for one third of our population to have less of the need of modern life than make for decent living

 our national purchasing power be the soil from which come all our prosperity the steady flow of wage to our million of worker be essential if the product of our industry and of our farmer be to be consume

 our far sight industrial leader now recognize that a very substantial share of corporate earning must be pay out in wage or the soil from which these industry grow will soon become impoverished our farmer recognize that their large customer be the worker for wage and that farm market can not be maintain except through widespread purchasing power

 this unemployment problem be therefore one in which every individual and every economic group have a direct interest it be a problem whose discussion must be remove from the field of prejudice to the field of logic we shall find the solution only when we have the fact and have the fact accept our mutual responsibility

 the inherent right to work be one of the elemental privilege of a free people continue failure to achieve that right and privilege by anyone who want to work and need work be a challenge to our civilization and to our security endow as our nation be with abundant physical resource and inspire as it should be with the high purpose to make those resource and opportunity available for the enjoyment of all we approach this problem of reemployment with the real hope of find a well answer than we have now

 the unemployment census as a sensible first step to a constructive re employment program ought to be a successful bit of national team work from which will come again that feeling of national solidarity which be the strength and the glory of the american people

five month have go by since i last speak to the people of the nation about the state of the nation
 i have hope to be able to defer this talk until next week because as we all know this be holy week but what i want to say to you the people of the country be of such immediate need and relate so closely to the life of human being and the prevention of human suffering that i have feel that there should be no delay in this decision i have be strengthen by the thought that by speak tonight there may be great peace of mind and that the hope of easter may be more real at fireside everywhere and therefore that it be not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of we be think of the prince of peace
 five year ago we face a very serious problem of economic and social recovery for four and a half year that recovery proceed apace it be only in the past seven month that it have receive a visible setback
 and it be only within the past two month as we have wait patiently to see whether the force of business itself would counteract it that it have become apparent that government itself can no long safely fail to take aggressive government step to meet it
 this recession have not return to we to the disaster and suffering of the beginning of 1933 your money in the bank be safe farmer be no long in deep distress and have great purchasing power danger of security speculation have be minimize national income be almost 50 high than it be in 1932 and government have an establish and accept responsibility for relief
 but i know that many of you have lose your job or have see your friend or member of your family lose their job and i do not propose that the government shall pretend not to see these thing i know that the effect of our present difficulty have be uneven that they have affect some group and some locality seriously but that they have be scarcely feel in other but i conceive the first duty of government be to protect the economic welfare of all the people in all section and in all group i say in my message open the last session of the congress that if private enterprise do not provide job this spring government would take up the slack that i would not let the people down we have all learn the lesson that government can not afford to wait until it have lose the power to act
 therefore my friend i have send a message of far reach importance to the congress i want to read to you tonight certain passage from that message and to talk with you about they
 in that message i analyze the cause of the collapse of 1929 in these word
 over speculation in and over production of practically every article or instrument use by man million of people to be sure have be put to work but the product of their hand have exceed the purchasing power of their pocketbook under the inexorable law of supply and demand supply so overran demand which would pay)that production be compel to stop unemployment and closed factory result hence the tragic year from 1929 to 1933
 today i point out to the congress that the national income not the government 's income but the total of the income of all the individual citizen and family of the united states every farmer every worker every banker every professional man and every person who live on income derive from investment that national income have amount in the year 1929 to eighty one billion dollar by 1932 this have fall to thirty eight billion dollar gradually and up to a few month ago it have rise to a total an annual total of sixty eight billion dollar a pretty good come- back from the low point
 i then say this to the congress
 but the very vigor of the recovery in both durable good and consumer good bring into the picture early in 1937 a year ago certain highly undesirable practice which be in large part responsible for the economic decline which begin in the later month of that year again production have outran outrun the ability to buy
 there be many reason for this over production one of they be fear fear of war abroad fear of inflation fear of nation wide strike none of these fear have be bear out
 production in many important line of good outrun the ability of the public to purchase they as i have say for example through the winter and spring of 1937 cotton factory in hundred of case be run on a three shift basis pile up cotton good in the factory and good in the hand of middle man and retailer for example also automobile manufacturer not only turn out a normal increase of finished car but encourage the normal increase to run into abnormal figure use every know method to push their sale this meant of course that the steel mill of the nation run on a twenty four hour basis and the tire company and cotton factory and glass factory and other speed up to meet the same type of abnormally stimulate demand yes the buying power of the nation lag behind
 thus by the autumn of 1937 last autumn the nation again have stock on hand which the consume public could not buy because the purchasing power of the consume public have not keep pace with the production
 during the same period the price of many vital product have rise fast than be warrant for example copper which undoubtedly can be produce at a profit in this country for from ten to twelve cent a pound be push up and up to seventeen cent a pound the price of steel product of many kind be increase far more than be justify by the increase wage of steel worker in the case of many commodity the price to the consumer be raise well above the inflationary boom price of 1929 in many line of good and material price get so high in the summer of 1937 that buyer and builder cease to buy or to build
 the economic process of get out the raw material put they through the manufacturing and finishing process sell they to the retailer sell they to the consumer and finally use they get completely out of balance
 the lay off of worker come upon we last autumn and have be continue at such a pace ever since that all of we government and banking and business and worker and those face with destitution recognize the need for action
 all of this i say to the congress today and i repeat it to you the people of the country tonight
 i go on to point out to the senate and the house of representatives that all the energy of government and business must be direct to increase the national income to put more people into private job to give security and a feeling of security to all people in all walk of life
 i be constantly think of all our people unemployed and employ alike of their human problem their human problem of food and clothing and home and education and health and old age you and i agree that security be our great need the chance to work the opportunity of make a reasonable profit in our business whether it be a very small business or a large one the possibility of sell our farm product for enough money for our family to live on decently i know these be the thing that decide the well being of all our people
 therefore i be determined to do all in my power to help you attain that security and because i know that the people themselves have a deep conviction that secure prosperity of that kind can not be a last one except on a basis of business fair business dealing and a basis where all from the top to the bottom share in the prosperity i repeat to the congress today that neither it nor the chief executive can afford
 to weaken or destroy great reform which during the past five year have be effect on behalf of the american people in our rehabilitation of the banking structure and of agriculture in our provision for adequate and cheap credit for all type of business in our acceptance of national responsibility for unemployment relief in our strengthening of the credit of state and local government in our encouragement of housing and slum clearance and home ownership in our supervision of stock exchange and public utility hold company and the issuance of new security in our provision for social security itself the electorate of america want no backward step take
 we have recognize the right of labor to free organization to collective bargaining and machinery for the handling of labor relation be now in existence the principle be establish even though we can all admit that through the evolution of time administration and practice can be improve such improvement can come about most quickly and most peacefully through sincere effort to understand and assist on the part of labor leader and employer alike
 the never cease evolution of human society will doubtless bring forth new problem which will require new adjustment our immediate task be to consolidate and maintain the gain we have achieve
 in this situation there be no reason and no occasion for any american to allow his fear to be arouse or his energy and enterprise to be paralyze by doubt or uncertainty
 i come to the conclusion that the present day problem call for action both by the government and by the people that we suffer primarily from a failure of consumer demand because of lack of buy power therefore it be up to we to create an economic upturn how and where can and should the government help to start an upward spiral economic upturn
 i go on in my message today to propose three group of measure and i will summarize my recommendation
 first i ask for certain appropriation which be intend to keep the government expenditure for work relief and similar purpose during the come fiscal year that begin on the first of july keep that go at the same rate of expenditure as at present that include additional money for the works progress administration additional fund for the farm security administration additional allotment for the national youth administration and more money for the civilian conservation corps in order that it can maintain the exist number of camp now in operation
 these appropriation make necessary by increased unemployment will cost about a billion and a quarter dollar more than the estimate which i send to the congress on the third of january last
 second i tell the congress that the administration propose to make additional bank reserve available for the credit need of the country about one billion four hundred million dollar of gold now in the treasury will be use to pay these additional expense of the government and three quarter of a billion dollar of additional credit will be make available to the bank by reduce the reserve now require by the federal reserve board
 these two step take care of relief need and add to bank credit be in our good judgment insufficient by themselves to start the nation on a sustained upward movement
 therefore i come to the third kind of government action which i consider to be vital i say to the congress
 you and i can not afford to equip ourselves with two round of ammunition where three round be necessary if we stop at relief and credit we may find ourselves without ammunition before the enemy be route if we be fully equip with the third round of ammunition we stand to win the battle against adversity
 this third proposal be to make definite addition to the purchase power of the nation by provide new work over and above the continue of the old work
 first to enable the united states housing authority to undertake the immediate construction of about three hundred million dollar worth of additional slum clearance project
 second to renew a public work program by start as quickly as possible about one billion dollar worth of need permanent public improvement in our state and their county and city
 third to add one hundred million dollar to the estimate for federal aid highway in excess of the amount that i recommend in january
 fourth to add thirty seven million dollar over and above the former estimate of sixty three million for flood control and reclamation
 fifth to add twenty five million dollar additional for federal building in various part of the country
 in recommend this program i be think not only of the immediate economic need of the people of the nation but also of their personal liberty --the most precious possession of all americans i be think of our democracy i be think of the recent trend in other part of the world away from the democratic ideal
 democracy have disappear in several other great nation disappear not because the people of those nation dislike democracy but because they have grow tired of unemployment and insecurity of see their child hungry while they sit helpless in the face of government confusion government weakness weakness through lack of leadership in government finally in desperation they choose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of get something to eat we in america know that our own democratic institution can be preserve and make to work but in order to preserve they we need to act together to meet the problem of the nation boldly and to prove that the practical operation of democratic government be equal to the task of protect the security of the people
 not only our future economic soundness but the very soundness of our democratic institution depend on the determination of our government to give employment to idle man the people of america be in agreement in defend their liberty at any cost and the first line of that defense lie in the protection of economic security your government seek to protect democracy must prove that government be strong than the force of business depression
 history prove that dictatorship do not grow out of strong and successful government but out of weak and helpless government if by democratic method people get a government strong enough to protect they from fear and starvation their democracy succeed but if they do not they grow impatient therefore the only sure bulwark of continue liberty be a government strong enough to protect the interest of the people and a people strong enough and well enough inform to maintain its sovereign control over its government
 we be a rich nation we can afford to pay for security and prosperity without have to sacrifice our liberty into the bargain
 in the first century of our republic we be short of capital short of worker and short of industrial production but we be rich very rich in free land and free timber and free mineral wealth the federal government of those day rightly assume the duty of promote business and relieve depression by give subsidy of land and other resource
 thus from our early day we have have a tradition of substantial government help to our system of private enterprise but today the government no long have vast tract of rich land to give away and we have discover too that we must spend large sum of money to conserve our land from further erosion and our forest from further depletion the situation be also very different from the old day because now we have plenty of capital bank and insurance company load with idle money plenty of industrial productive capacity and many million of worker look for job it be follow tradition as well as necessity if government strive to put idle money and idle man to work to increase our public wealth and to build up the health and strength of the people --to help our system of private enterprise to function again
 it be go to cost something to get out of this recession this way but the profit of get out of it will pay for the cost several time over lose working time be lose money every day that a workman be unemployed or a machine be unused or a business organization be mark time it be a loss to the nation because of idle man and idle machine this nation lose one hundred billion dollar between 1929 and the spring of 1933 in less than four year this year you the people of this country be make about twelve billion dollar less than you be last year
 if you think back to the experience of the early year of this administration you will remember the doubt and fear express about the rise expense of government but to the surprise of the doubter as we proceed to carry on the program which include public works and work relief the country grow rich instead of poor
 it be worthwhile to remember that the annual national people 's income be thirty billion dollar more last year in 1937 than it be in 1932 it be true that the national debt increase sixteen billion dollar but remember that in that increase must be include several billion dollar worth of asset which eventually will reduce that debt and that many billion dollar of permanent public improvement school road bridge tunnel public building park and a host of other thing meet your eye in every one of the thirty one hundred county in the united states
 no doubt you will be tell that the government spending program of the past five year do not cause the increase in our national income they will tell you that business revive because of private spending and investment that be true in part for the government spend only a small part of the total but that government spending act as a trigger a trigger to set off private activity that be why the total addition to our national production and national income have be so much great than the contribution of the government itself
 in pursuance of that thought i say to the congress today
 i want to make it clear that we do not believe that we can get an adequate rise in national income merely by investing and lending or spend public fund it be essential in our economy that private fund must be put to work and all of we recognize that such fund be entitle to a fair profit
 as national income rise let we not forget that government expenditure will go down and government tax receipt will go up
 the government contribution of land that we once make to business be the land of all the people and the government contribution of money which we now make to business ultimately come out of the labor of all the people it be therefore only sound morality as well as a sound distribution of buy power that the benefit of the prosperity come from this use of the money of all the people ought to be distribute among all the people the people at the bottom as well as the people at the top consequently i be again express my hope that the congress will enact at this session a wage and hour bill put a floor under industrial wage and a limit on work hour to ensure a well distribution of our prosperity a well distribution of available work and a sounder distribution of buy power
 you may get all kind of impression in regard to the total cost of this new program or in regard to the amount that will be add to the net national debt
 it be a big program last autumn in a sincere effort to bring government expenditure and government income into close balance the budget i work out call for sharp de crease in government spending during the come year
 but in the light of present condition condition of today those estimate turn out to have be far too low this new program add two billion and sixty two million dollar to direct treasury expenditure and another nine hundred and fifty million dollar to government loan the latter sum because they be loan will come back to the treasury in the future
 the net effect on the debt of the government be this between now and july 1 1939 fifteen month away the treasury will have to raise less than a billion and a half dollar of new money
 such an addition to the net debt of the united states need not give concern to any citizen for it will return to the people of the united states many time over in increase buying power and eventually in much great government tax receipt because of the increase in the citizen income
 what i say to the congress today in the close of my message i repeat to you now let we unanimously recognize the fact that the federal debt whether it be twenty five billion or forty billion can only be pay if the nation obtain a vastly increase citizen income i repeat that if this citizen income can be raise to eighty billion dollar a year the national government and the overwhelming majority of state and local government will be definitely out of the red the high the national income go the fast will we be able to reduce the total of federal and state and local debt view from every angle today 's purchasing power -the citizen income of today be not at this time sufficient to drive the economic system of america at high speed responsibility of government require we at this time to supplement the normal process and in so supplement they to make sure that the addition be adequate we must start again on a long steady upward incline in national income
 and in that process which i believe be ready to start let we avoid the pitfall of the past the overproduction the over speculation and indeed all the extreme which we do not succeed in avoid in 1929 in all of this government can not and should not act alone business must help and i be sure business will help
 we need more than the material of recovery we need a united national will
 we need to recognize nationally that the demand of no group however just can be satisfied unless that group be prepared to share in find a way to produce the income from which they and all other group can be pay you as the congress i as the president must by virtue of our office seek the national good by preserve the balance between all group and all section
 we have at our disposal the national resource the money the skill of hand and head to raise our economic level our citizen income our capacity be limit only by our ability to work together what be need be the will
 the time have come to bring that will into action with every drive force at our command and i be determined to do my share
 certain positive requirement seem to i to accompany the will if we have that will
 there be place on all of we the duty of self restraint that be the discipline of a democracy every patriotic citizen must say to himself or herself that immoderate statement appeal to prejudice the creation of unkindness be offense not against an individual or individual but offense against the whole population of the united states
 use of power by any group however situate to force its interest or to use its strategic position in order to receive more from the common fund than its contribution to the common fund justifie be an attack against and not an aid to our national life
 self restraint imply restraint by articulate public opinion train to distinguish fact from falsehood train to believe that bitterness be never a useful instrument in public affair there can be no dictatorship by an individual or by a group in this nation save through division foster by hate such division there must never be
 and finally i should like to say a personal word to you
 i never forget that i live in a house own by all the american people and that i have be give their trust
 i try always to remember that their deep problem be human i constantly talk with those who come to tell i their own point of view with those who manage the great industry and financial institution of the country --with those who represent the farmer and the worker and often very often with average citizen without high position who come to this house and constantly i seek to look beyond the door of the white house beyond the officialdom of the national capital into the hope and fear of man and woman in their home i have travel the country over many time my friend my enemy my daily mail bring to i report of what you be think and hope i want to be sure that neither battle nor burden of office shall ever blind i to an intimate knowledge of the way the american people want to live and the simple purpose for which they put i here
 in these great problem of government i try not to forget that what really count at the bottom of it all be that the man and woman willing to work can have a decent job a decent job to take care of themselves and their home and their child adequately that the farmer the factory worker toe storekeeper the gas station man the manufacturer the merchant big and small the banker who take pride in the help that he can give to the building of his community that all of these can be sure of a reasonable profit and safety for the earning that they make not for today nor tomorrow alone but as far ahead as they can see
 i can hear your unspoken wonder as to where we be head in this troubled world i can not expect all of the people to understand all of the people 's problem but it be my job to try to understand all of the problem
 i always try to remember that reconcile difference can not satisfy everyone completely because i do not expect too much i be not disappointed but i know that i must never give up that i must never let the great interest of all the people down merely because that might be for the moment the easy personal way out
 i believe that we have be right in the course we have chart to abandon our purpose of build a great a more stable and a more tolerant america would be to miss the tide and perhaps to miss the port i propose to sail ahead i feel sure that your hope and i feel sure that your help be with i for to reach a port we must sail sail not lie at anchor sail not drift

i think the american public and the american newspaper be certainly creature of habit this be one of the warm evening that i have ever feel in washington d. c. and yet this talk tonight will be refer to as a fireside talk
 our government happily be a democracy as part of the democratic process your president be again take an opportunity to report on the progress of national affair to report to the real ruler of this country --the vote public
 the seventy fifth congress elect in november 1936 on a platform uncompromisingly liberal have adjourn bar unforeseen event there will be no session until the new congress to be elect in november assemble next january
 on the one hand the seventy fifth congress have leave many thing undo
 for example it refuse to provide more businesslike machinery for run the executive branch of the government the congress also fail to meet my suggestion that it take the far reach step necessary to put the railroad of the country back on their foot
 but on the other hand the congress strive to carry out the platform on which most of they be elect achieve more for the future good of the country than any congress do between the end of the world war and the spring of 1933
 i mention tonight only the more important of these achievement
 1 the congress improve still far our agricultural law to give the farmer a fair share of the national income to preserve our soil to provide an all weather granary to help the farm tenant towards independence to find new use for farm product and to begin crop insurance
 2 after many request on my part the congress pass a fair labor standards act what we call the wages and hours bill that act --applye to product in interstate commerce end child labor set a floor below wage and a ceiling over hour of labor
 except perhaps for the social security act it be the most far reach the most far sighted program for the benefit of worker ever adopt here or in any other country without question it start we toward a well standard of living and increase purchase power to buy the product of farm and factory
 do not let any calamity howl executive with an income of $ 1,000.00 a day who have be turn his employee over to the government relief roll in order to preserve his company 's undistributed reserve tell you use his stockholder money to pay the postage for his personal opinion tell you that a wage of $ 11.00 a week be go to have a disastrous effect on all american industry fortunately for business as a whole and therefore for the nation that type of executive be a rarity with whom most business executive most heartily disagree
 3 the congress have provide a fact find commission to find a path through the jungle of contradictory theory about the wise business practice to find the necessary fact for any intelligent legislation on monopoly on price fixing and on the relationship between big business and medium sized business and little business different from a great part of the world we in america persist in our belief in individual enterprise and in the profit motive but we realize we must continually seek improved practice to insure the continuance of reasonable profit together with scientific progress individual initiative opportunity for the little fellow fair price decent wage and continue employment
 4 the congress have coordinate the supervision of commercial aviation and air mail by establish a new civil aeronautics authority and it have place all postmaster under the civil service for the first time in our national history
 5 the congress have set up the united states housing administration authority to help finance large scale slum clearance and provide low rent housing for the low income group in our city and by improve the federal housing act the congress have make it easy for private capital to build modest home and low rental dwelling
 6 the congress have properly reduce taxis on small corporate enterprise and have make it easy for the reconstruction finance corporation to make credit available to all business i think the banker of the country can fairly be expect to participate in loan where the government through the reconstruction finance corporation r. f. c. offer to take a fair portion of the risk
 7 so too the congress have provide additional fund for the works progress administration the public works administration the rural electrification administration the civilian conservation corps and other agency in order to take care of what we hope be a temporary additional number of unemployed at this time and to encourage production of every kind by private enterprise
 all these thing together i call our program for the national defense of our economic system it be a program of balanced action of move on all front at once in intelligent recognition that all of our economic problem of every group and of every section of the country be essentially one problem
 8) finally because of increase armament in other nation and an international situation which be definitely disturbing to all of we the congress have authorize important addition to the national armed defense of our shore and our people
 on another one other important subject the net result of a struggle in the congress have be an important victory for the people of the united states what might well be call a lost battle which win a war you will remember that a year and a half ago nearly on february 5 1937 i send a message to the congress deal with the real need of federal court reform of several kind in one way or another during the session of this congress the end i speak of the real objective seek in the that message have be substantially attain
 the attitude of the supreme court towards constitutional question be entirely change its recent decision be eloquent testimony of a willingness to collaborate with the two other branch of government to make democracy work the government have be grant the right to protect its interest in litigation between private party involve the constitutionality of federal statute when the constitutionality of federal statute be involve and to appeal directly to the supreme court in all case involve the constitutionality of federal statute and no single judge be any long empower to suspend a federal statute on his sole judgment as to its constitutionality a justice(s of the supreme court may now retire at the age of seventy after ten year of service and a substantial number of additional judgeship have be create in order to expedite the trial of case and finally great flexibility have be add to the federal judicial system by allow judge to be assign to congested district
 another indirect accomplishment of this congress have be i think its response to the devotion of the american people to a course of sane and consistent liberalism the congress have understand that under modern condition government have a continue responsibility to meet continue problem and that government can not take a holiday of a year or a month or even a day just because a few people be tired or frighten by the inescapable pace fast pace of this modern world in which we live
 some of my opponent and some of my associate have consider that i have a mistakenly sentimental judgment as to the tenacity of purpose and the general level of intelligence of the american people
 i be still convinced that the american people since 1932 continue to insist on two requisite of private enterprise and the relationship of government to it the first be a complete honesty a complete honesty at the top in look after the use of other people 's money and in apportion and pay individual and corporate taxis accord to in accordance with ability to pay and the second be sincere respect for the need of all people who be at the bottom all people at the bottom who need to get work and through work to get a really fair share of the good thing of life and a chance to save and a chance to rise
 after the election of 1936 i be tell and the congress be tell by an increase number of politically and worldly-- wise people that i should coast along enjoy an easy presidency for four year and not take the democratic platform too seriously they tell i that people be get weary of reform through political effort and would no long oppose that small minority which in spite of its own disastrous leadership in 1929 be always eager to resume its control over the government of the united states
 never in our lifetime have such a concerted campaign of defeatism be throw at the head of the president and the senators and congressmen as in the case of this seventy fifth congress never before have we have so many copperhead among we and you will remember that it be the copperheads who in the day of the civil war the war between the states try their good to make president lincoln and his congress give up the fight in the middle of the fight to let the nation remain split in two and return to peace yes peace at any price
 this congress have end on the side of the people my faith in the american people and their faith in themselves have be justify i congratulate the congress and the leadership thereof and i congratulate the american people on their own staying power
 one word about our economic situation it make no difference to i whether you call it a recession or a depression in 1932 the total national income of all the people in the country have reach the low point of thirty eight billion dollar in that year with each succeed year it rise last year 1937 it have rise to seventy billion dollar despite definitely bad business and agricultural price in the last four month of last year this year 1938 while it be too early to do more than give an a mere estimate we hope that the national income will not fall below sixty billion dollar and that be a lot well than thirty- eight billion dollar we remember also that banking and business and farming be not fall apart like the one hoss shay as they do in the terrible winter of 1932 to 1933
 last year mistake be make by the leader of private enterprise by the leader of labor and by the leader of government --all three
 last year the leader of private enterprise plead for a sudden curtailment of public spending and say they would take up the slack but they make the mistake of increase their inventory too fast and set many of their price too high for their good to sell
 some labor leader goad by decade of oppression of labor make the mistake of go too far they be not wise in use method which frighten many well wish people they ask employer not only to bargain with they but to put up with jurisdictional dispute at the same time
 government too make mistake mistake of optimism in assume that industry and labor would themselves make no mistake and government make a mistake of timing in not pass a farm bill or a wage and hour bill last year as a result of the lesson of all these mistake we hope that in the future private enterprise capital and labor alike will operate more intelligently together and operate in great cooperation with their own government than they have in the past such cooperation on the part of both of they will be very welcome to i certainly at this stage there should be a united stand on the part of both of they to resist wage cut which would far reduce purchasing power
 this afternoon only a few hour ago i be tell that a great steel company announce a reduction in price with a view to stimulate business recovery and i be tell and i be gratified to know that this reduction in price have involve no wage cut every encouragement ought to be give to industry which accept the large volume and high wage policy
 if this be do throughout the nation it ought to result in condition which will replace a great part of the government spending which the failure of cooperation have make necessary this year
 you will remember that from march 4 1933 down to date not a single week have pass without a cry from the opposition a small opposition a cry to do something to say something to restore confidence there be a very articulate group of people in this country with plenty of ability to procure publicity for their view who have consistently refuse to cooperate with the mass of the people whether thing be go well or go badly on the ground that they require more concession to their point of view before they would admit have what they call confidence
 these people demand restoration of confidence when the bank be close and demand it again when the bank be reopen
 they demand restoration of confidence when hungry people be throng the our street and demand it again now when the hungry people be feed and put to work
 they demand restoration of confidence when drought hit the country and demand it again now when our field be laden with bounteous yield and excessive crop
 they demand restoration of confidence last year when the automobile industry be run three shift day and night turn out more car than the country could buy and they be demand it again this year when the industry be try to get rid of an automobile surplus and have shut down its factory as a result
 but my friend it be my belief that many of these people who have be cry aloud for confidence be begin today to realize that that hand have be overplay and that they be now willing to talk cooperation instead it be my belief that the mass of the american people do have confidence in themselves have confidence in their ability with the aid of government to solve their own problem
 it be because you be not satisfied and i be not satisfied with the progress that we have make in finally solve our business and agricultural and social problem that i believe the great majority of you want your own government to keep on try to solve they in simple frankness and in simple honesty i need all the help i can get and i see sign of get more help in the future from many who have fight against progress with tooth and nail in the past
 and now follow out this line of thought i want to say a few word about the come political primary
 fifty year ago party nomination be generally make in convention a system typify in the public imagination by a little group in a smoke fill room who make out the party slate
 the direct primary be invent to make the nominating process a more democratic one to give the party voter themselves a chance to pick their party candidate
 what i be go to say to you tonight do not relate to the primary of any particular political party but to matter of principle in all party democratic republican farmer labor progressive socialist or any other let that be clearly understand
 it be my hope that everybody affiliate with any party will vote in the primary and that every such voter will consider the fundamental principle for which his or her party be on record that make for a healthy choice between the candidate of the oppose party on election day in november
 an election can not give the country a firm sense of direction if it have two or more national party which merely have different name but be as alike in their principle and aim as pea in the same pod
 in the come primary in all party there will be many clash between two school of thought generally classify as liberal and conservative roughly speak the liberal school of thought recognize that the new condition throughout the world call for new remedy
 those of we in america who hold to this school of thought insist that these new remedy can be adopt and successfully maintain in this country under our present form of government if we use government as an instrument of cooperation to provide these remedy we believe that we can solve our problem through continue effort through democratic process instead of fascism or communism we be oppose to the kind of moratorium on reform which in effect be mean reaction itself
 be it clearly understand however that when i use the word liberal i mean the believer in progressive principle of democratic representative government and not the wild man who in effect lean in the direction of communism for that be just as dangerous to we as fascism itself
 the opposing or conservative school of thought as a general proposition do not recognize the need for government itself to step in and take action to meet these new problem it believe that individual initiative and private philanthropy will solve they that we ought to repeal many of the thing we have do and go back for instance example to the old gold standard or stop all this business of old age pension and unemployment insurance or repeal the securities and exchange act or let monopoly thrive unchecked --return in effect to the kind of government that we have in the nineteen twenty
 assume the mental capacity of all the candidate the important question which it seem to i the primary voter must ask be this to which of these general school of thought do the candidate belong
 as president of the united states i be not ask the voter of the country to vote for democrats next november as oppose to republicans or member of any other party nor be i as president take part in democratic primary
 as the head of the democratic party however charge with the responsibility of carry out the definitely liberal declaration of principle set forth in the 1936 democratic platform i feel that i have every right to speak in those few instance where there may be a clear cut issue between candidate for a democratic nomination involve these principle or involve a clear misuse of my own name
 do not misunderstand i i certainly would not indicate a preference in a state primary merely because a candidate otherwise liberal in outlook have conscientiously differ with i on any single issue i should be far more concerned about the general attitude of a candidate towards present day problem and his own inward desire to get practical need attend to in a practical way we you and i all know that progress may be block by outspoken reactionary and also but we also know that progress can be block by those who say yes to a progressive objective but who always find some reason to oppose any special specific proposal to gain that objective i call that type of candidate a yes but fellow
 and i be concern about the attitude of a candidate or his sponsor with respect to the right of american citizen to assemble peaceably and to express publicly their view and opinion on important social and economic issue there can be no constitutional democracy in any community which deny to the individual his freedom to speak and worship as he wish the american people will not be deceive by anyone who attempt to suppress individual liberty under the pretense of patriotism
 this be a free country with freedom of expression --especially with freedom of the press as be entirely proper there will be a lot of mean blow strike between now and election day by blow i mean misrepresentation and personal attack and appeal to prejudice it would be a lot well of course if campaign everywhere could be wage with argument instead of with blow
 i hope the liberal candidate will confine themselves to argument and not resort to blow for in nine case out of ten the speaker or the writer who seek to influence public opinion descend from calm argument to unfair blow hurt himself more than his opponent
 the chinese have a story on this a story base on three or four thousand year of civilization two chinese coolie be argue heatedly in the midst middle of a crowd in the street a stranger express surprise that no blow be be strike by they his chinese friend reply the man who strike first admit that his idea have give out
 i know that neither in the summer primary nor in the november election will the american voter fail to spot the candidate whose idea have give out

governor davey senator bulkley chairman white and you the people of the northwest territory
 long before 1788 there be white man here spy out this land of canaan an intrepid outpost breed they be the scout and the skirmisher of the great american migration the sight of smoke from neighbor chimney might have worry they but indians and redcoat do not
 long before 1788 at kaskaskia and vincennes with scant help from the seaboard they have hold their beloved wilderness for themselves and for we with their own bare hand and their own long rifle but their symbol be vincennes not marietta
 here with all honor to the scout and the skirmisher we celebrate the coming of a different type of man and woman the first battalion of that organize army of occupation which transplant from over the alleghenies whole little civilization that take root and grow they be give expression to a genius for organized colonization carefully plan and order under law
 the man who come here before 1788 come as leif ericson 's man to vineland in a spirit all of adventure but the man and woman of the ohio company who come to marietta come rather like the man and woman of the massachusetts bay company to boston an organized society unafraid to meet temporary adventure but serious in seek permanent security for man and woman and child and home many of they be destine to push on but most come intend to stay such people may not be the first to conquer the earth but they will always be the last to possess it
 right behind the man and woman who establish marietta one hundred and fifty year ago move that instrument of law and order and cooperation government a representative of the national government enter marietta to administer the northwest territory under the famous northwest ordinance and what we be celebrate today be this establishment of the first civil government west of the original thirteen state
 three provision of the northwest ordinance i always like to remember
 it provide that no person demean himself in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molest on account of his mode of worship or for religious sentiment in the said territory
 it provide that religion morality and knowledge be necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind school and mean of education shall forever be encourage
 and it provide for the perpetual prohibition of slavery in the territory
 free educate god fear man and woman that be what the thirteen state hope the new west would exemplify it have well fulfil that hope
 every generation meet substantially the same problem under its own different set of circumstance anyone speculate on our great migration westward be strike with the human parallel between the drive force behind that migration and the drive force behind the great social exploration we be carry on today
 most of the people who go out to ohio in 1788 and who follow wave on wave for another hundred year go to improve their economic lot in other word they be follow the same yearning for security which be drive we forward today
 at the end of the wagon rut there be something worth the physical risk the standard of life in a log cabin amid field still blacken with half burn stump be not high but it be certain a family or at most a township could be a whole self suffice economic system plenty of food to eat if a man would but reach out and shoot or cultivate it plenty of warm clothe if the woman of the family be willing to spin always a tight roof over the family 's head if the little community would respond to the call for a roof raising
 whatever he use be a man 's own he have the solid joy of possession of own his home and his mean of livelihood and if thing do not pan out there be always an infinite self sufficiency beckon far westward to new land new game new opportunity
 under such condition there be so much to get do which man could not get do alone that the frontiersman naturally reach out to government as their great single instrument of cooperative self help with the aid of which they could get thing do to they the use of government be but another form of the cooperation of good neighbor
 government be an indispensable instrument of their daily life of the security of their woman and their child and their home and their opportunity they look on government not as a thing apart as a power over our people they regard it as a power of the people as a democratic expression of organized self help like a frontier husking bee
 there be worried legalist back in the seaboard town who be sure it be unconstitutional for the federal government to help to put road and railroad and canal through these new territory who be sure that the nation would never get back the money it be plow into development of the natural and human resource of the northwest
 but abraham lincoln who incarnate the spirit of the people who be actually live in the northwest territory sum up their attitude when he say the legitimate object of government be to do for a community of people whatever they need to have do but can not do at all or can not do so well for themselves in their separate and individual capacity
 today under new condition a whole nation the critical thirteen state and all the west and south that have grow out of they be on a mental migration dissatisfied with old condition seek like the little band that come to marietta to create new condition of security and again the people see an ally in their own government
 many a man do not own his cabin any more his possession be a bank deposit
 scarcely any man can call his neighbor to raise his roof any more he pay a contractor cash and have to have mortgage financing to find the cash and if that financing be of the wrong kind or go bad he may need help to save his home from foreclosure
 once old age be safe because there be always something useful which man and woman no matter how old could do to earn an honorable maintenance that time be go and some new kind of organize old age insurance have to be provide
 in these perplexity the individual turn as he have always turn to the collective security of the willingness of his fellow to cooperate through the use of government to help he and each other the spirit of the frontier husking bee be find today in carefully draft statute statute insure bank deposit statute provide mortgage money for home through f.h.a. statute provide help through h.o.l.c. for those in danger of foreclosure the cavalry captain who protect the log cabin of the northwest be now supplant by legislator like senator bulkley toil over the drafting of such statute and over the efficiency of government machinery to administer they so that such protection and help of government can be extend to the full
 on a thousand front government state and municipal as well as federal be play the same role of the insurer of security for the average man woman and child that the army detachment play in the early day of the old northwest territory when you think it through at the bottom most of the great protective statute of today be in essence mutual insurance company and our recent legislation be not a departure from but a return to the healthy practice of mutual self help of the early settler of the northwest
 let we not be afraid to help each other let we never forget that government be ourselves and not an alien power over we the ultimate ruler of our democracy be not a president and senators and congressmen and government official but the voter of this country
 i believe that the american people not afraid of their own capacity to choose forward look representative to run their government want the same cooperative security and have the same courage to achieve it in 1938 as in 1788 i be sure they know that we shall always have a frontier of social and economic problem and that we must always move in to bring law and order to it in that confidence i be push on i be sure that the people of the nation will push on with i

my fellow americans and my friend
 tonight my single duty be to speak to the whole of america
 until four thirty this morning i have hope against hope that some miracle would prevent a devastating war in europe and bring to an end the invasion of poland by germany
 for four long year a succession of actual war and constant crisis have shake the entire world and have threaten in each case to bring on the gigantic conflict which be today unhappily a fact
 it be right that i should recall to your mind the consistent and at time successful effort of your government in these crisis to throw the full weight of the united states into the cause of peace in spite of spread war i think that we have every right and every reason to maintain as a national policy the fundamental morality the teaching of religion and the continuation of effort to restore peace for because some day though the time may be distant we can be of even great help to a crippled humanity
 it be right too to point out that the unfortunate event of these recent year have without question be base on the use of force or and the threat of force and it seem to i clear even at the outbreak of this great war that the influence of america should be consistent in seek for humanity a final peace which will eliminate as far as it be possible to do so the continue use of force between nation
 it be of course impossible to predict the future i have my constant stream of information from american representative and other source throughout the world you the people of this country be receive news through your radio and your newspaper at every hour of the day
 you be i believe the most enlighten and the well inform people in all the world at this moment you be subject to no censorship of news and i want to add that your government have no information which it hesitate to withhold from you or which it have any thought of withholding from you
 at the same time as i tell my press conference on friday it be of the high importance that the press and the radio use the utmost caution to discriminate between actual verify fact on the one hand and mere rumor on the other
 i can add to that by say that i hope the people of this country will also discriminate most carefully between news and rumor do not believe of necessity everything you hear or read check up on it first
 you must master at the outset a simple but unalterable fact in modern foreign relation between nation when peace have be break anywhere the peace of all country everywhere be in danger
 it be easy for you and for i to shrug our shoulder and to say that conflict take place thousand of mile from the continental united states and indeed thousand of mile from the whole american hemisphere do not seriously affect the americas and that all the united states have to do be to ignore they and go about our its own business passionately though we may desire detachment we be force to realize that every word that come through the air every ship that sail the sea every battle that be fight do affect the american future
 let no man or woman thoughtlessly or falsely talk of america send its army to european field at this moment there be be prepare a proclamation of american neutrality this would have be do even if there have be no neutrality statute on the book for this proclamation be in accordance with international law and in accordance with american policy
 this will be follow by a proclamation require by the exist neutrality act and i trust that in the day to come our neutrality can be make a true neutrality
 it be of the utmost importance that the people of this country with the good information in the world think thing through the most dangerous enemy of american peace be those who without well rounded information on the whole broad subject of the past the present and the future undertake to speak with assumed authority to talk in term of glitter generality to give to the nation assurance or prophecy which be of little present or future value
 i myself can not and do not prophesy the course of event abroad and the reason be that because i have of necessity such a complete picture of what be go on in every part of the world that i do not dare to do so and the other reason be that i think it be honest for i to be honest with the people of the united states
 i can not prophesy the immediate economic effect of this new war on our nation but i do say that no american have the moral right to profiteer at the expense either of his fellow citizen or of the man the woman and the child who be live and die in the midst of war in europe
 some thing we do know most of we in the united states believe in spiritual value most of we regardless of what church we belong to believe in the spirit of the new testament a great teaching which oppose itself to the use of force of armed force of march army and fall bomb the overwhelming masse of our people seek peace peace at home and the kind of peace in other land which will not jeopardize our peace at home
 we have certain idea and certain ideal of national safety and we must act to preserve that safety today and to preserve the safety of our child in future year
 that safety be and will be bind up with the safety of the western hemisphere and of the sea adjacent thereto we seek to keep war from our own fireside by keep war from come to the americas for that we have historic precedent that go back to the day of the administration of president george washington it be serious enough and tragic enough to every american family in every state in the union to live in a world that be tear by war on other continent and those war today they affect every american home it be our national duty to use every effort to keep they those war out of the americas
 and at this time let i make the simple plea that partisanship and selfishness be adjourn and that national unity be the thought that underlie all other
 this nation will remain a neutral nation but i can not ask that every american remain neutral in thought as well even a neutral have a right to take account of fact even a neutral can not be ask to close his mind or close his conscience
 i have say not once but many time that i have see war and that i hate war i say that again and again
 i hope the united states will keep out of this war i believe that it will and i give you assurance(s and reassurance that every effort of your government will be direct toward that end
 as long as it remain within my power to prevent there will be no blackout of peace in the united states

my friend
 at this moment of sadness throughout most of the world i want to talk with you about a number of subject that directly affect the future of the united states we be shock by the almost incredible eyewitness story that come to we story of what be happen at this moment to the civilian population of norway and holland and belgium and luxembourg and france
 i think it be right on this sabbath evening that i should say a word in behalf of woman and child and old man who need help immediate help in their present distress help from we across the sea help from we who be still free to give it
 tonight over the once peaceful road of belgium and france million be now move run from their home to escape bomb and shell and fire and machine gunning without shelter and almost wholly without food they stumble on know not where the end of the road will be i remind speak to you of these people because each one of you that be listen to i tonight have a way of help they the american red cross which that represent each of we be rush food and clothing and medical supply to these destitute civilian million please i beg you please give accord to your mean to your near red cross chapter give as generously as you can i ask this in the name of our common humanity
 let we sit down again together again you and i to consider our own press problem that confront we
 there be many among we who in the past close their eye to event abroad --because they believe in utter good faith what some of their fellow americans tell they that what be take place in europe be none of our business that no matter what happen over there the united states could always pursue its peaceful and unique course in the world
 there be many among we who close their eye from lack of interest or lack of knowledge honestly and sincerely think that the many hundred of mile of salt water make the american hemisphere so remote that the people of north and central and south america could go on live in the midst of their vast resource without reference to or danger from other continents of the world
 there be some among we who be persuade by minority group that we could maintain our physical safety by retire within our continental boundary the atlantic on the east the pacific on the west canada on the north and mexico on the south i illustrate the futility the impossibility of that idea in my message to the congress last week obviously a defense policy base on that be merely to invite future attack
 and finally there be a few among we who have deliberately and consciously close their eye because they be determined to be oppose to their government its foreign policy and every other policy to be partisan and to believe that anything that the government do be wholly wrong
 to those who have close their eye for any of these many reason to those who would not admit the possibility of the approach storm to all of they the past two week have mean the shattering of many illusion
 they have lose the illusion that we be remote and isolated and therefore secure against the danger from which no other land be free
 in some quarter with this rude awakening have come fear fear border on panic it be say that we be defenseless it be whisper by some that only by abandon our freedom our ideal our way of life can we build our defense adequately can we match the strength of the aggressor
 i do not share those illusion i do not share these fear
 today we be now more realistic but let we not be calamity howler and discount our strength let we have do with both fear and illusion on this sabbath evening in our home in the midst of our american family let we calmly consider what we have do and what we must do
 in the past two or three week all kind of story have be hand out to the american public about our lack of preparedness it have even be charge that the money we have spend on our military and naval force during the last few year have go down the rat hole i think that it be a matter of fairness to the nation that you hear the fact
 yes we have spend large sum of money on the national defense this money have be use to make our army and navy today the large the good equip and the well train peace time military establishment in the whole history of this country
 let i tell you just a few of the many thing accomplish during the past few year
 i do not propose i can not to go into every detail it be a known fact however that in 1933 when this administration come into office the united states navy have fall in stand among the navy of the world in power of ship and in efficiency to a relatively low ebb the relative fighting power on the navy have be greatly diminish by failure to replace ship and equipment which have become out of date
 but between 1933 and this year 1940 seven fiscal year your government will have spend $ 1,487,000,000 a billion four hundred eighty seven million dollar more than it spend on the navy during the seven year before that precede 1933 what do we get for the money money incidentally not include in the new defense appropriation only the money heretofore appropriate
 the fighting personnel of the navy rise from 79,000 to 145,000
 during this period 215 ship for the fighting fleet have be lay down or commission practically seven time the number in the precede similar seven year period
 of these 215 ship we have commission 12 cruiser 63 destroyer 26 submarine 3 aircraft carrier 2 gunboat 7 auxiliary and many small craft and among the many ship now be build and pay for as we build they be 8 new battleship
 ship construction of course cost million of dollar more in the united states than anywhere else in the world but it be a fact that we can not have adequate navy defense for all american water without ship ship that sail the surface of the ocean ship that move under the surface and ship that move through the air and speak of airplane airplane that work with the navy in 1933 we have 1,127 of they 1,127 useful aircraft and today we have 2,892 on hand and on order of course nearly all of the old plane of 1933 plane have be replace by new plane because they become obsolete or wear out
 the navy be far strong today than at any peace time period in the whole long history of the nation in hit power and in efficiency i would even make the assertion that it be strong today than it be during the world war
 the army of the united states in 1933 it consist of 122,000 enlisted man now in 1940 that number have be practically double the army of 1933 have be give few new implement of war since 1919 and have be compel to draw on old reserve stock leave over from the world war
 the net result of all this be that our army by l933 have very greatly decline in its ratio of strength with the army of europe and of the far east
 that be the situation i find but since then great change have take place
 between 1933 and 1940 these past seven fiscal year your government will have spend $ 1,292,000,000 more than it spend on the army the previous seven year
 what do we get for this money
 the personnel of the army as i have say have be almost double and by the end of this year every exist unit of the present regular army will be equip with its complete requirement of modern weapon exist unit of the national guard will also be largely equip with similar item
 here be some striking example take from a large number of they
 since 1933 we have actually purchase 5,640 airplane include the most modern type of long range bomber and fast pursuit plane though of course many of these which be deliver 4 and 5 and 6 or and 7 year ago have wear out through use and be scrap
 we must remember that these plane cost money a lot of it for example one modern four engine long range bombing plane cost $ 350,000 one modern interceptor pursuit plane cost $ 133,000 one medium bomber cost $ 160,000
 to go on in 1933 we have only 355 anti aircraft gun we now have more than 1,700 modern anti craft gun of all type on hand or on order and you ought to know that a three inch anti aircraft gun cost $ 40,000 without any of the fire control equipment that go with it
 in 1933 there be only 24 modern infantry mortar in the entire army we now have on hand and on order more than 1,600
 in 1933 we have only 48 modern tank and armored car today we have on hand and on order 1,700 each one of our heavy tank cost $ 46,000
 there be many other item in which our progress since 1933 have be rapid and the great proportion of this advance have be during the last two year consist of really modern equipment
 for instance in 1933 on the personnel side we have 1,263 army pilot today the army alone have more than 3,200 of the good fighting flyer in the world flyer who last year fly more than one million hour in combat training this and that figure do not include the hundred of splendid pilot in the national guard and in the organized reserve
 within the past year the productive capacity of the aviation industry to produce military plane have be tremendously increase in the past year the capacity more than double but this that capacity today however be still inadequate but the government work with industry be determined to increase this that capacity to meet our need we intend to harness the efficient machinery of these manufacturer to the government 's program of be able to get 50,000 plane a year
 one additional word about aircraft about which we read so much recent war include the current war in europe have demonstrate beyond doubt that fight efficiency depend on unity of command unity of control
 in sea operation the airplane be just as much an integral part of the unity of operation as be the submarine the destroyer and the battleship and in land warfare the airplane be just as much a part of military operation as be the tank corps the engineer the artillery or the infantry itself therefore the air force should continue to be part of the army and navy
 in line with my request the congress this week be vote the large appropriation ever ask by the army or the navy in peacetime and the equipment and training provide by for they will be in addition to the figure i have give you
 the world situation may so change that it will be necessary to reappraise our program at any time and in such case i be confident that the congress and the chief executive will work in harmony as a team work in harmony as they be do today
 i will not hesitate at any moment to ask for additional fund when they be require
 in this era of swift mechanized warfare we all have to remember that what be modern today and up to date what be efficient and practical become obsolete and outwear tomorrow
 even while the production line turn out airplane new airplane ones)are be design on the drafting table
 even as a cruiser slide down the launch way plan for improvement plan for increase efficiency in the next model be take shape in the blueprint of designer
 every day 's fighting in europe on land on sea and in the air disclose constant change in method of warfare we be constantly improve and redesign test new weapon learn the lesson of the immediate war and seek to produce in accordance with the late that the brain on science can conceive
 yes we be call upon the resource the efficiency and the ingenuity of the american manufacturer of war material of all kind airplane and tank and gun and ship and all the hundred of product that go into this material the government of the united states itself manufacture few of the implement of war private industry will continue to be the source of most of this material and private industry will have to be speed up to produce it at the rate and efficiency call for by the need of the time
 i know that private business can not be expect to make all of the capital investment require for expansion of plant and factory and personnel which this program call for at once it would be unfair to expect industrial corporation or their investor to do this when there be a chance that a change in international affair may stop or curtail future order a year or two hence
 therefore the government of the united states stand ready to advance the necessary money to help provide for the enlargement of factory the establishment of new plant the employment of thousand of necessary worker the development of new source of supply for the hundred of raw material require the development of quick mass transportation of supply and the detail of all of this be now be work out in washington day and night
 we be call on man now engage in private industry to help we in carry out this program and you will hear more of this in detail in the next few day
 this do not mean that the man we call upon will be engage in the actual production of this material that will still have to be carry on in the plant and factory throughout the land private industry will have the responsibility of provide the good speedy and most efficient mass production of which it be capable the function of the businessman whose assistance we be call upon will be to coordinate this program to see to it that all of the plant continue to operate at maximum speed and efficiency
 patriotic americans of prove merit and of unquestioned ability in their special field be come to washington to help the government with their training their experience and their capability
 it be our purpose not only to speed up production but to increase the total facility of the nation in such a way that they can be far enlarge to meet emergency of the future
 but as this program proceed there be several thing we must continue to watch and safeguard thing which be just as important to the sound defense of a nation as physical armament itself while our navy and our airplane and our gun and our ship may be our first line of defense it be still clear that way down at the bottom underlie they all give they their strength sustenance and power be the spirit and morale of a free people
 for that reason we must make sure in all that we do that there be no breakdown or cancellation of any of the great social gain which we have make in these past year we have carry on an offensive on a broad front against social and economic inequality and abuse which have make our society weak that offensive should not now be break down by the pincer movement of those who would use the present need of physical military defense to destroy it
 there be nothing in our present emergency to justify make the worker of our nation toll for long hour than now limit by statute as more order come in and as more work have to be do ten of thousand of people who be now unemployed will i believe receive employment
 there be nothing in our present emergency to justify a lowering of the standard of employment minimum wage should not be reduce it be my hope indeed that the new speed up of production will cause many business which now pay below the minimum standard to bring their wage up
 there be nothing in our present emergency to justify a breaking down of old age pension or of unemployment insurance i would rather see the system extend to other group who do not now enjoy they
 there be nothing in our present emergency to justify a retreat from any of our social objective from conservation of natural resource assistance to agriculture housing and help to the underprivileged
 conversely however i be sure that responsible leader will not permit some specialized group which represent a minority of the total employee of a plant or an industry to break up the continuity of employment of the majority of the employee let we remember that the policy and the law that provide provide for collective bargaining be still in force and i can assure you that labor will be adequately represent in washington in this defense program the carry out of this program of defense
 and one more point on this also our present emergency and a common sense of decency make it imperative that no new group of war millionaire shall come into be in this nation as a result of the struggle abroad the american people will not relish the idea of any american citizen grow rich and fat in an emergency of blood and slaughter and human suffering
 and finally last of all this emergency demand that the consumer of america be protect so that our general cost of living can be maintain at a reasonable level we ought to avoid the spiral process of the world war the rise spiral of cost of all kind the sound policy be for every employer in the country to help give useful employment to the million who be unemployed by give to those million an increase purchasing power the prosperity of the whole country nation will rise to a much high level
 today 's threat to our national security be not a matter of military weapon alone we know of new other method new method of attack
 the trojan horse the fifth column that betray a nation unprepared for treachery spy saboteur and traitor be the actor in this new strategy with all of these we must and will deal vigorously
 but there be an add technique for weaken a nation at its very root for disrupt the entire pattern of life of a people and it be important that we understand it
 the method be simple it be first discord a dissemination of discord a group --not too large a group that may be sectional or racial or political be encourage to exploit their its prejudice through false slogan and emotional appeal the aim of those who deliberately egg on these group be to create confusion of counsel public indecision political paralysis and eventually a state of panic
 sound national policy come to be view with a new and unreasoning skepticism not through the wholesome political debate of honest and free man but through the clever scheme of foreign agent
 as a result of these new technique armament program may be dangerously delay singleness of national purpose may be undermine man can lose confidence in each other and therefore lose confidence in the efficacy of their own united action faith and courage can yield to doubt and fear the unity of the state be can be so sap that its strength be destroy
 all this be no idle dream it have happen time after time in nation after nation during here in the last two year fortunately american man and woman be not easy dupe campaign of group hatred or class struggle have never make much headway among we and be not make headway now but new force be be unleash deliberately plan propaganda to divide and weaken we in the face of danger as other nation have be weaken before
 these dividing force be i do not hesitate to call undiluted poison they must not be allow to spread in the new world as they have in the old our moral and our mental defense must be raise up as never before against those who would cast a smoke screen across our vision
 the development of our defense program make it essential that each and every one of we man and woman feel that we have some contribution to make toward the security of our country nation
 at this time when the world and the world include our own american hemisphere when the world be threaten by force of destruction it be my resolve and your to build up our armed defense
 we shall build they to whatever height the future may require
 we shall rebuild they swiftly as the method of warfare swiftly change
 for more than three century we americans have be build on this continent a free society a society in which the promise of the human spirit may find fulfillment commingled here be the blood and genius of all the people of the world who have seek this promise
 we have build well we be continue our effort to bring the blessing of a free society of a free and productive economic system to every family in the land this be the promise of america
 it be this that we must continue to build this that we must continue to defend
 it be the task of our generation your and mine but we build and defend not for our generation alone we defend the foundation lay down by our father we build a life for generation yet unborn we defend and we build a way of life not for america alone but for all mankind ours be a high duty a noble task
 day and night i pray for the restoration of peace in this mad world of our it be not necessary that i the president ask the american people to pray in behalf of such a cause for i know you be pray with i
 i be certain that out of the heart of every man woman and child in this land in every wake minute a supplication go up to almighty god that all of we beg that suffer and starving that death and destruction may end and that peace may return to the world in common affection for all mankind your prayer join with mine that god will heal the wound and the heart of humanity

president newcomb my friend of the university of virginia

 i notice by the program that i be ask to address the class of 1940 i avail myself of that privilege but i also take this very apt occasion to speak to many other class that have graduate through all the year class that be still in the period of study not alone in the school of learning of the nation but class that have come up through the great school of experience in other word a cross section of the country just as you who graduate today be a cross section of the nation as a whole

 every generation of young man and woman in america have question to ask the world most of the time they be the simple but nevertheless difficult question question of work to do opportunity to find ambition to satisfy

 but every now and again in the history of the republic a different kind of question present itself a question that ask not about the future of an individual or even of a generation but about the future of the country the future of the american people

 there be such a time at the beginning of our history as a nation young people ask themselves in those day what lie ahead not for themselves but for the new united states

 there be such a time again in the seemingly endless year of the war between the states young man and young woman on both side of the line ask themselves not what trade or profession they would enter what live they would make but what be to become of the country they have know

 there be such a time again today again today the young man and the young woman of america ask themselves with earnestness and with deep concern this same question what be to become of the country we know

 now they ask it with even great anxiety than before they ask not only what the future hold for this republic but what the future hold for all people and all nation that have be live under democratic form of government under the free institution of a free people

 it be understandable to all of we that they should ask this question they read the word of those who be tell they that the ideal of individual liberty the ideal of free franchise the ideal of peace through justice be decadent ideal they read the word and hear the boast of those who say that a belief in force force direct by self choose leader be the new and vigorous system which will overrun the earth they have see the ascendancy of this philosophy of force in nation after nation where free institution and individual liberty be once maintain

 it be natural and understandable that the young generation should first ask itself what the extension of the philosophy of force to all the world would lead to ultimately we see today in stark reality some of the consequence of what we call the machine age

 where control of machine have be retain in the hand of mankind as a whole untold benefit have accrue to mankind for mankind be then the master and the machine be the servant

 but in this new system of force the mastery of the machine be not in the hand of mankind it be in the control of infinitely small group of individual who rule without a single one of the democratic sanction that we have know the machine in hand of irresponsible conqueror become the master mankind be not only the servant it be the victim too such mastery abandon with deliberate contempt all the moral value to which even this young country for more than three hundred year have be accustom and dedicate

 surely the new philosophy prove from month to month that it could have no possible conception of the way of life or the way of thought of a nation whose origin go back to jamestown and plymouth rock

 conversely neither those who spring from that ancient stock nor those who have come hither in later year can be indifferent to the destruction of freedom in their ancestral land across the sea

 perception of danger to our institution may come slowly or it may come with a rush and a shock as it have to the people of the united states in the past few month this perception of danger have come to we clearly and overwhelmingly and we perceive the peril in a world wide arena an arena that may become so narrow that only the americas will retain the ancient faith

 some indeed still hold to the now somewhat obvious delusion that we of the united states can safely permit the united states to become a lone island a lone island in a world dominate by the philosophy of force

 such an island may be the dream of those who still talk and vote as isolationist such an island represent to i and to the overwhelming majority of americans today a helpless nightmare of a people without freedom the nightmare of a people lodge in prison handcuffed hungry and feed through the bar from day to day by the contemptuous unpitying master of other continent

 it be natural also that we should ask ourselves how now we can prevent the building of that prison and the placing of ourselves in the midst of it

 let we not hesitate all of we to proclaim certain truth overwhelmingly we as a nation and this apply to all the other american nation be convince that military and naval victory for the god of force and hate would endanger the institution of democracy in the western world and that equally therefore the whole of our sympathy lie with those nation that be give their life blood in combat against these force

 the people and the government of the united states have see with the utmost regret and with grave disquiet the decision of the italian government to engage in the hostility now rage in europe

 more than three month ago the chief of the italian government send i word that because of the determination of italy to limit so far as might be possible the spread of the european conflict more than two hundred million of people in the region of the mediterranean have be enable to escape the suffering and the devastation of war

 i inform the chief of the italian government that this desire on the part of italy to prevent the war from spread meet with full sympathy and response on the part of the government and the people of the united states and i express the earnest hope of this government and of this people that this policy on the part of italy might be continue i make it clear that in the opinion of the government of the united states any extension of hostility in the region of the mediterranean might result in a still great enlargement of the scene of the conflict the conflict in the near east and in africa and that if this come to pass no one could foretell how much great the theater of the war eventually might become

 again on a subsequent occasion not so long ago recognize that certain aspiration of italy might form the basis of discussion among the power most specifically concerned i offer in a message address to the chief of the italian government to send to the government of france and of great britain such specific indication of the desire of italy to obtain readjustment with regard to her position as the chief of the italian government might desire to transmit through i while make it clear that the government of the united states in such an event could not and would not assume responsibility for the nature of the proposal submit nor for agreement which might thereafter be reach i propose that if italy would refrain from enter the war i would be willing to ask assurance from the other power concern that they would faithfully execute any agreement so reach and that italy 's voice in any future peace conference would have the same authority as if italy have actually take part in the war as a belligerent

 unfortunately to the regret of all of we and the regret of humanity the chief of the italian government be unwilling to accept the procedure suggest and he have make no counter proposal

 this government direct its effort to do what it could to work for the preservation of peace in the mediterranean area and it likewise express its willingness to endeavor to cooperate with the government of italy when the appropriate occasion arise for the creation of a more stable world order through the reduction of armament and through the construction of a more liberal international economic system which would assure to all power equality of opportunity in the world 's market and in the securing of raw material on equal term

 i have likewise of course feel it necessary in my communication to signor mussolini to express the concern of the government of the united states because of the fact that any extension of the war in the region of the mediterranean would inevitably result in great prejudice to the way of life and government and to the trade and commerce of all the american republics

 the government of italy have now choose to preserve what it term its freedom of action and to fulfill what it state be its promise to germany in so do it have manifest disregard for the right and security of other nation disregard for the life of the people of those nation which be directly threaten by this spread of the war and have evidence its unwillingness to find the mean through pacific negotiation for the satisfaction of what it believe be its legitimate aspiration

 on this tenth day of june nineteen hundred and forty the hand that hold the dagger have strike it into the back of its neighbor

 on this tenth day of june nineteen hundred and forty in this university found by the first great american teacher of democracy we send forth our prayer and our hope to those beyond the sea who be maintain with magnificent valor their battle for freedom

 in our american unity we will pursue two obvious and simultaneous course we will extend to the opponent of force the material resource of this nation and at the same time we will harness and speed up the use of those resource in order that we ourselves in the americas may have equipment and training equal to the task of any emergency and every defense

 all road lead to the accomplishment of these objective must be keep clear of obstruction we will not slow down or detour sign and signal call for speed full speed ahead

 it be right that each new generation should ask question but in recent month the principal question have be somewhat simplified once more the future of the nation and of the american people be at stake

 we need not and we will not in any way abandon our continue effort to make democracy work within our border we still insist on the need for vast improvement in our own social and economic life but that be a component part of national defense itself

 the program unfold swiftly and into that program will fit the responsibility and the opportunity of every man and woman in the land to preserve his and her heritage in day of peril

 i call for effort courage sacrifice devotion grant the love of freedom all of these be possible

 and the love of freedom be still fierce and steady in the nation today

member of the convention my friend
 it be very late but i have feel that you would rather that i speak to you now than wait until tomorrow
 it be with a very full heart that i speak tonight i must confess that i do so with mixed feeling because i find myself as almost everyone do soon or later in his lifetime in a conflict between deep personal desire for retirement on the one hand and that quiet invisible thing call conscience on the other
 because there be self appoint commentator and interpreter who will seek to misinterpret or question motive i speak in a somewhat personal vein and i must trust to the good faith and common sense of the american people to accept my own good faith and to do their own interpreting
 when in 1936 i be choose by the voter for a second time as president it be my firm intention to turn over the responsibility of government to other hand at the end of my term that conviction remain with i eight year in the presidency follow a period of bleak depression and cover one world crisis after another would normally entitle any man to the relaxation that come from honorable retirement
 during the spring of 1939 world event make it clear to all but the blind or the partisan that a great war in europe have become not merely a possibility but a probability and that such a war would of necessity deeply affect the future of this nation
 when the conflict first break out last september it be still my intention to announce clearly and simply at an early date that under no condition would i accept reelection this fact be well known to my friend and i think be understand by many citizen
 it soon become evident however that such a public statement on my part would be unwise from the point of view of sheer public duty as president of the united states it be my clear duty with the aid of the congress to preserve our neutrality to shape our program of defense to meet rapid change to keep our domestic affair adjust to shift world condition and to sustain the policy of the good neighbor
 it be also my obvious duty to maintain to the utmost the influence of this mighty nation in our effort to prevent the spread of war and to sustain by all legal mean those government threaten by other government which have reject the principle of democracy
 swiftly move foreign event make necessary swift action at home and beyond the sea plan for national defense have to be expand and adjust to meet new form of warfare american citizen and their welfare have to be safeguard in many foreign zone of danger national unity in the united states become a cry essential in the face of the development of unbelievable type of espionage and international treachery
 every day that passed call for the postponement of personal plan and partisan debate until the late possible moment the normal condition under which i would have make public declaration of my personal desire be wholly go
 and so think solely of the national good and of the international scene i come to the reluctant conclusion that such declaration should not be make before the national convention it be accordingly make to you within an hour after the permanent organization of this convention
 like any other man i be compliment by the honor you have do i but i know you will understand the spirit in which i say that no call of party alone would prevail upon i to accept reelection to the presidency
 the real decision to be make in these circumstance be not the acceptance of a nomination but rather an ultimate willingness to serve if choose by the electorate of the united states many consideration enter into this decision
 during the past few month with due congressional approval we in the united states have be take step to implement the total defense of america i can not forget that in carry out this program i have draft into the service of the nation many man and woman take they away from important
 private affair call they suddenly from their home and their business i have ask they to leave their own work and to contribute their skill and
 experience to the cause of their nation
 i as the head of their government have ask they to do this regardless of party regardless of personal convenience they come they answer the call every single one of they with one exception have come to the nation 's capital to serve the nation
 these people who have place patriotism above all else represent those who have make their way to what might be call the top of their profession or industry through their proven skill and experience
 but they alone could not be enough to meet the need of the time
 just as a system of national defense base on man power alone without the mechanized equipment of modern warfare be totally insufficient for adequate national defense so also plane and gun and tank be wholly insufficient unless they be implement by the power of man train to use they
 such man power consist not only of pilot and gunner and infantry and those who operate tank for every individual in actual combat service it be necessary for adequate defense that we have ready at hand at least four or five other train individual organize for non combat service
 because of the million of citizen involve in the conduct of defense most right thinking person be agree that some form of selection by draft be as necessary and fair today as it be in 1917 and 1918
 nearly every american be willing to do his share or her share to defend the united states it be neither just nor efficient to permit that task to fall upon any one section or any one group for every section and every group depend for their existence upon the survival of the nation as a whole
 lie awake as i have on many night i have ask myself whether i have the right as commander in chief of the army and navy to call on man and woman to serve their country or to train themselves to serve and at the same time decline to serve my country in my own personal capacity if i be call upon to do so by the people of my country
 in time like these in time of great tension of great crisis the compass of the world narrow to a single fact the fact which dominate our world be the fact of armed aggression the fact of successful armed aggression aim at the form of government the kind of society that we in the united states have choose and establish for ourselves it be a fact which no one long doubt which no one be long able to ignore
 it be not an ordinary war it be a revolution impose by force of arm which threaten all man everywhere it be a revolution which propose not to set man free but to reduce they to slavery to reduce they to slavery in the interest of a dictatorship which have already show the nature and the extent of the advantage which it hope to obtain
 that be the fact which dominate our world and which dominate the life of all of we each and every one of we in the face of the danger which confront our time no individual retain or can hope to retain the right of personal choice which free man enjoy in time of peace he have a first obligation to serve in the defense of our institution of freedom a first obligation to serve his country in whatever capacity his country find he useful
 like most man of my age i have make plan for myself plan for a private life of my own choice and for my own satisfaction a life of that kind to begin in january 1941 these plan like so many other plan have be make in a world which now seem as distant as another planet today all private plan all private life have be in a sense repeal by an override public danger in the face of that public danger all those who can be of service to the republic have no choice but to offer themselves for service in those capacity for which they may be fit
 those my friend be the reason why i have have to admit to myself and now to state to you that my conscience will not let i turn my back upon a call to service
 the right to make that call rest with the people through the american method of a free election only the people themselves can draft a president if such a draft should be make upon i i say to you in the utmost simplicity i will with god 's help continue to serve with the good of my ability and with the fullness of my strength
 to you the delegate of this convention i express my gratitude for the selection of henry wallace for the high office of vice president of the united states his first hand knowledge of the problem of government in every sphere of life and in every single part of the nation and indeed of the whole world qualify he without reservation his practical idealism will be of great service to i individually and to the nation as a whole
 and to the chairman of the national committee the postmaster general of the united states my old friend jim farley i send as i have often before and shall many time again my most affectionate greeting all of we be sure that he will continue to give all the leadership and support that he possibly can to the cause of american democracy
 in some respect as i think my good wife suggest an hour or so ago the next few month will be different from the usual national campaign of recent year
 most of you know how important it be that the president of the united states in these day remain close to the seat of government since last summer i have be compel to abandon propose journey to inspect many of our great national project from the alleghenies to the pacific coast
 event move so fast in other part of the world that it have be come my duty to remain either in the white house itself or at some near by point where i can reach washington and even europe and asia by direct telephone where if need be i can be back at my desk in the space of a very few hour and in addition the splendid work of the new defense machinery will require i to spend vastly more time in conference with the responsible administration head under i finally the add task which the present crisis have impose also upon the congress compel they to forego their usual adjournment call for constant cooperation between the executive and legislative branch to the efficiency of which i be glad indeed now to pay tribute
 i do expect of course during the come month to make my usual periodic report to the country through the medium of press conference and radio talk i shall not have the time or the inclination to engage in purely political debate but i shall never be loath to call the attention of the nation to deliberate or unwitting falsification of fact which be sometimes make by political candidate
 i have speak to you in a very informal and personal way the exigency of the day require however that i also talk with you about thing which transcend any personality and go very deeply to the root of american civilization
 our life have be base on those fundamental freedom and liberty which we americans have cherish for a century and a half the establishment of they and the preservation of they in each succeed generation have be accomplish through the process of free elective government the democratic republican form base on the representative system and the coordination of the executive the legislative and the judicial branch
 the task of safeguard our institution seem to i to be twofold one must be accomplish if it become necessary by the armed defense force of the nation the other by the united effort of the man and woman of the country to make our federal and state and local government responsive to the grow requirement of modern democracy
 there have be occasion as we remember when reaction in the march of democracy have set in and forward look progress have seem to stop
 but such period have be follow by liberal and progressive time which have enable the nation to catch up with new development in fulfil new human need such a time have be the past seven year because we have seem to lag in previous year we have have to develop speedily and efficiently the answer to aspiration which have come from every state and every family in the land
 we have sometimes call it social legislation we have sometimes call it legislation to end the abuse of the past we have sometimes call it legislation for human security and we have sometimes call it legislation to better the condition of life of the many million of our fellow citizen who could not have the essential of life or hope for an american standard of living
 some of we have label it a wide and more equitable distribution of wealth in our land it have include among its aim to liberalize and broaden the control of vast industry lodge today in the hand of a relatively small group of individual of very great financial power
 but all of these definition and label be essentially the expression of one consistent thought they represent a constantly grow sense of human decency human decency throughout our nation
 this sense of human decency be happily confine to no group or class you find it in the humblest home you find it among those who toil and among the shopkeeper and the farmer of the nation you find it to a grow degree even among those who be list in that top group which have so much control over the industrial and financial structure of the nation therefore this urge of humanity can by no mean be label a war of class against class it be rather a war against poverty and suffering and ill health and insecurity a war in which all class be join in the interest of a sound and endure democracy
 i do not believe for a moment and i know that you do not believe either that we have fully answer all the need of human security but we have cover much of the road i need not catalogue the milestone of seven year for every individual and every family in the whole land know that the average of their personal life have be make safe and sounder and happy than it have ever be before i do not think they want the gain in these direction to be repeal or even to be place in the charge of those who would give they mere lip service with no heart service
 yes very much more remain to be do and i think the voter want the task entrust to those who believe that the word human betterment apply to poor and rich alike
 and i have a sneak suspicion too that voter will smile at charge of inefficiency against a government which have boldly meet the enormous problem of banking and finance and industry which the great efficient banker and industrialist of the republican party leave in such hopeless chaos in the famous year 1933
 but we all know that our progress at home and in the other american nation toward this realization of a well human decency progress along free line be gravely endanger by what be happen on other continent in europe many nation through dictatorship or invasion have be compel to abandon normal democratic process they have be compel to adopt form of government which some call new and efficient
 they be not new my friend they be only a relapse a relapse into ancient history the omnipotent ruler of the great part of modern europe have guarantee efficiency and work and a type of security
 but the slave who build the pyramid for the glory of the dictator pharaohs of egypt have that kind of security that kind of efficiency that kind of corporative state
 so do the inhabitant of that world which extend from britain to persia under the undisputed rule of the proconsul send out from rome
 so do the henchman the tradesman the mercenary and the slave of the feudal system which dominate europe a thousand year ago
 so do the people of those nation of europe who receive their king and their government at the whim of the conquer napoleon
 whatever its new trapping and new slogan tyranny be the old and most discredit rule know to history and whenever tyranny have replace a more human form of government it have be due more to internal cause than external democracy can thrive only when it enlist the devotion of those whom lincoln call the common people democracy can hold that devotion only when it adequately respect their dignity by so order society as to assure to the masse of man and woman reasonable security and hope for themselves and for their child
 we in our democracy and those who live in still unconquered democracy will never willingly descend to any form of this so call security of efficiency which call for the abandonment of other security more vital to the dignity of man it be our credo unshakable to the end that we must live under the liberty that be first herald by magna carta and place into glorious operation through the declaration of independence the constitution of the united states and the bill of rights
 the government of the united states for the past seven year have have the courage openly to oppose by every peaceful mean the spread of the dictator form of government if our government should pass to other hand next january untried hand inexperienced hand we can merely hope and pray that they will not substitute appeasement and compromise with those who seek to destroy all democracy everywhere include here
 i would not undo if i could the effort i make to prevent war from the moment it be threaten and to restrict the area of carnage down to the last minute i do not now soften the condemnation express by secretary hull and myself from time to time for the act of aggression that have wipe out ancient liberty love peace pursue country which have scrupulously maintain neutrality i do not recant the sentiment of sympathy with all free people resist such aggression or begrudge the material aid that we have give to they i do not regret my consistent endeavor to awaken this country to the menace for we and for all we hold dear
 i have pursue these effort in the face of appeaser fifth columnist who charge i with hysteria and war mongering but i feel it my duty my simple plain inescapable duty to arouse my countryman to the danger of the new force let loose in the world
 so long as i be president i will do all i can to insure that that foreign policy remain our foreign policy
 all that i have do to maintain the peace of this country and to prepare it morally as well as physically for whatever contingency may be in store i submit to the judgment of my countryman we face one of the great choice of history
 it be not alone a choice of government by the people versus dictatorship
 it be not alone a choice of freedom versus slavery
 it be not alone a choice between move forward or fall back it be all of these roll into one
 it be the continuance of civilization as we know it versus the ultimate destruction of all that we have hold dear religion against godlessness the ideal of justice against the practice of force moral decency versus the firing squad courage to speak out and to act versus the false lullaby of appeasement
 but it have be well say that a selfish and greedy people can not be free
 the american people must decide whether these thing be worth make sacrifice of money of energy and of self they will not decide by listen to mere word or by read mere pledge interpretation and claim they will decide on the record the record as it have be make the record of thing as they be
 the american people will sustain the progress of a representative democracy ask the divine blessing as they face the future with courage and with faith

my friend
 this be not a fireside chat on war it be a talk on national security because the nub of the whole purpose of your president be to keep you now and your child later and your grandchild much later out of a last ditch war for the preservation of american independence and all of the thing that american independence mean to you and to i and to ours
 tonight in the presence of a world crisis my mind go back eight year to a night in the midst of a domestic crisis it be a time when the wheel of american industry be grind to a full stop when the whole banking system of our country have cease to function
 i well remember that while i sit in my study in the white house prepare to talk with the people of the united states i have before my eye the picture of all those americans with whom i be talk i see the workman in the mill the mine the factory the girl behind the counter the small shopkeeper the farmer do his spring plowing the widow and the old man wonder about their life 's saving
 i try to convey to the great mass of american people what the banking crisis mean to they in their daily life
 tonight i want to do the same thing with the same people in this new crisis which face america
 we meet the issue of 1933 with courage and realism
 we face this new crisis this new threat to the security of our nation with the same courage and realism
 never before since jamestown and plymouth rock have our american civilization be in such danger as now
 for on september 27th 1940 this year by an agreement sign in berlin three powerful nation two in europe and one in asia join themselves together in the threat that if the united states of america interfere with or block the expansion program of these three nation a program aim at world control they would unite in ultimate action against the united states
 the nazi master of germany have make it clear that they intend not only to dominate all life and think in their own country but also to enslave the whole of europe and then to use the resource of europe to dominate the rest of the world
 it be only three week ago their leader state this there be two world that stand oppose to each other and then in defiant reply to his opponent he say this other be correct when they say with this world we can not ever reconcile ourselves i can beat any other power in the world so say the leader of the nazis
 in other word the axis not merely admit but the axis proclaim that there can be no ultimate peace between their philosophy of government and our philosophy of government
 in view of the nature of this undeniable threat it can be assert properly and categorically that the united states have no right or reason to encourage talk of peace until the day shall come when there be a clear intention on the part of the aggressor nation to abandon all thought of dominating or conquer the world
 at this moment the force of the state that be league against all people who live in freedom be be hold away from our shore the germans and the italians be be block on the other side of the atlantic by the british and by the greeks and by thousand of soldier and sailor who be able to escape from subjugate country in asia the japanese be be engage by the chinese nation in another great defense
 in the pacific ocean be our fleet
 some of our people like to believe that war in europe and in asia be of no concern to we but it be a matter of most vital concern to we that european and asiatic war maker should not gain control of the ocean which lead to this hemisphere
 one hundred and seventeen year ago the monroe doctrine be conceive by our government as a measure of defense in the face of a threat against this hemisphere by an alliance in continental europe thereafter we stand on guard in the atlantic with the british as neighbor there be no treaty there be no unwritten agreement
 and yet there be the feeling prove correct by history that we as neighbor could settle any dispute in peaceful fashion and the fact be that during the whole of this time the western hemisphere have remain free from aggression from europe or from asia
 do anyone seriously believe that we need to fear attack anywhere in the americas while a free britain remain our most powerful naval neighbor in the atlantic and do anyone seriously believe on the other hand that we could rest easy if the axis power be our neighbor there
 if great britain go down the axis power will control the continent of europe asia africa australia and the high sea and they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resource against this hemisphere it be no exaggeration to say that all of we in all the americas would be live at the point of a gun a gun load with explosive bullet economic as well as military
 we should enter upon a new and terrible era in which the whole world our hemisphere include would be run by threat of brute force and to survive in such a world we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy
 some of we like to believe that even if great britain fall we be still safe because of the broad expanse of the atlantic and of the pacific
 but the width of those these ocean be not what it be in the day of clipper ship at one point between africa and brazil the distance be less from washington than it be from washington to denver colorado five hour for the late type of bomber and at the north end of the pacific ocean america and asia almost touch each other
 why even today we have plane that which could fly from the british isles to new england and back again without refuel and remember that the range of a the modern bomber be ever be increase
 during the past week many people in all part of the nation have tell i what they want i to say tonight almost all of they express a courageous desire to hear the plain truth about the gravity of the situation one telegram however express the attitude of the small minority who want to see no evil and hear no evil even though they know in their heart that evil exist that telegram beg i not to tell again of the ease with which our american city could be bomb by any hostile power which have gain basis in this western hemisphere the gist of that telegram be please mr. president do not frighten we by tell we the fact
 frankly and definitely there be danger ahead danger against which we must prepare but we well know that we can not escape danger it or the fear of danger by crawl into bed and pull the cover over our head
 some nation of europe be bind by solemn non intervention pact with germany other nation be assure by germany that they need never fear invasion non intervention pact or not the fact remain that they be attack overrun and throw into the modern form of slavery at an hour 's notice or even without any notice at all as an exiled leader of one of these nation say to i the other day the notice be a minus quantity it be give to my government two hour after german troop have pour into my country in a hundred place
 the fate of these nation tell we what it mean to live at the point of a nazi gun
 the nazis have justify such action by various pious fraud one of these fraud be the claim that they be occupy a nation for the purpose of restore order another be that they be occupy or control a nation on the excuse that they be protect it against the aggression of somebody else
 for example germany have say that she be occupy belgium to save the belgians from the british would she then hesitate to say to any south american country we be occupy you to protect you from aggression by the united states
 belgium today be be use as an invasion base against britain now fight for its life and any south american country in nazi hand would always constitute a jump off place for german attack on any one of the other republic of this hemisphere
 analyze for yourself the future of two other place even near to germany if the nazis win could ireland hold out would irish freedom be permit as an amazing pet exception in an unfree world or the islands of the azores which still fly the flag of portugal after five century you and i think of hawaii as an outpost of defense in the pacific and yet the azores be close to our shore in the atlantic than hawaii be on the other side
 there be those who say that the axis power would never have any desire to attack the western hemisphere that this be the same dangerous form of wishful thinking which have destroy the power of resistance of so many conquered people the plain fact be that the nazis have proclaim time and again that all other race be their inferior and therefore subject to their order and most important of all the vast resource and wealth of this american hemisphere constitute the most tempting loot in all of the round world
 let we no long blind ourselves to the undeniable fact that the evil force which have crush and undermine and corrupt so many other be already within our own gate your government know much about they and every day be ferret they out
 their secret emissary be active in our own and in neighboring country they seek to stir up suspicion and dissension to cause internal strife they try to turn capital against labor and vice versa they try to reawaken long slumber racist and religious enmity which should have no place in this country they be active in every group that promote intolerance they exploit for their own end our own natural abhorrence of war these trouble breeder have but one purpose it be to divide our people to divide they into hostile group and to destroy our unity and shatter our will to defend ourselves
 there be also american citizen many of then in high place who unwittingly in most case be aid and abet the work of these agent i do not charge these american citizen with be foreign agent but i do charge they with do exactly the kind of work that the dictator want do in the united states
 these people not only believe that we can save our own skin by shut our eye to the fate of other nation some of they go much far than that they say that we can and should become the friend and even the partner of the axis power some of they even suggest that we should imitate the method of the dictatorship but americans never can and never will do that
 the experience of the past two year have prove beyond doubt that no nation can appease the nazis no man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroke it there can be no appeasement with ruthlessness there can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb we know now that a nation can have peace with the nazis only at the price of total surrender
 even the people of italy have be force to become accomplice of the nazis but at this moment they do not know how soon they will be embrace to death by their ally
 the american appeaser ignore the warning to be find in the fate of austria czechoslovakia poland norway belgium the netherlands denmark and france they tell you that the axis power be go to win anyway that all of this bloodshed in the world could be save that the united states might just as well throw its influence into the scale of a dictate peace and get the good out of it that we can
 they call it a negotiate peace nonsense be it a negotiate peace if a gang of outlaws surround your community and on threat of extermination make you pay tribute to save your own skin
 such a dictate peace would be no peace at all it would be only another armistice lead to the most gigantic armament race and the most devastating trade war in all history and in these contest the americas would offer the only real resistance to the axis power
 with all their vaunted efficiency with all their and parade of pious purpose in this war there be still in their background the concentration camp and the servant of god in chain
 the history of recent year prove that the shooting and the chain and the concentration camp be not simply the transient tool but the very altar of modern dictatorship they may talk of a new order in the world but what they have in mind be only but a revival of the old and the bad tyranny in that there be no liberty no religion no hope
 the proposed new order be the very opposite of a united states of europe or a united states of asia it be not a government base upon the consent of the governed it be not a union of ordinary self respect man and woman to protect themselves and their freedom and their dignity from oppression it be an unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and to enslave the human race
 the british people and their ally today be conduct an active war against this unholy alliance our own future security be greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight our ability to keep out of war be go to be affect by that outcome
 think in term of today and tomorrow i make the direct statement to the american people that there be far less chance of the united states get into war if we do all we can now to support the nation defend themselves against attack by the axis than if we acquiesce in their defeat submit tamely to an axis victory and wait our turn to be the object of attack in another war later on
 if we be to be completely honest with ourselves we must admit that there be risk in any course we may take but i deeply believe that the great majority of our people agree that the course that i advocate involve the least risk now and the great hope for world peace in the future
 the people of europe who be defend themselves do not ask we to do their fighting they ask we for the implement of war the plane the tank the gun the freighter which will enable they to fight for their liberty and for our security emphatically we must get these weapon to they get they to they in sufficient volume and quickly enough so that we and our child will be save the agony and suffering of war which other have have to endure
 let not the defeatist tell we that it be too late it will never be early tomorrow will be later than today
 certain fact be self evident
 in a military sense great britain and the british empire be today the spearhead of resistance to world conquest and they be put up a fight which will live forever in the story of human gallantry
 there be no demand for send an american expeditionary force outside our own border there be no intention by any member of your government to send such a force you can therefore nail nail any talk about send army to europe as deliberate untruth
 our national policy be not direct toward war its sole purpose be to keep war away from our country and away from our people
 democracy 's fight against world conquest be be greatly aid and must be more greatly aid by the rearmament of the united states and by send every ounce and every ton of munition and supply that we can possibly spare to help the defender who be in the front line and it be no more unneutral for we to do that than it be for sweden russia and other nation near germany to send steel and ore and oil and other war material into germany every day in the week
 we be plan our own defense with the utmost urgency and in its vast scale we must integrate the war need of britain and the other free nation which be resist aggression
 this be not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion it be a matter of realistic practical military policy base on the advice of our military expert who be in close touch with exist warfare these military and naval expert and the member of the congress and the administration have a single minded purpose the defense of the united states
 this nation be make a great effort to produce everything that be necessary in this emergency and with all possible speed and this great effort require great sacrifice
 i would ask no one to defend a democracy which in turn would not defend everyone in the nation against want and privation the strength of this nation shall not be dilute by the failure of the government to protect the economic well being of its all citizen
 if our capacity to produce be limit by machine it must ever be remember that these machine be operate by the skill and the stamina of the worker as the government be determined to protect the right of the worker so the nation have a right to expect that the man who man the machine will discharge their full responsibility to the urgent need of defense
 the worker possess the same human dignity and be entitle to the same security of position as the engineer or the manager or the owner for the worker provide the human power that turn out the destroyer and the air)planes and the tank
 the nation expect our defense industry to continue operation without interruption by strike or lockout it expect and insist that management and worker will reconcile their difference by voluntary or legal mean to continue to produce the supply that be so sorely need
 and on the economic side of our great defense program we be as you know bend every effort to maintain stability of price and with that the stability of the cost of living
 nine day ago i announce the setting up of a more effective organization to direct our gigantic effort to increase the production of munition the appropriation of vast sum of money and a well coordinate executive direction of our defense effort be not in themselves enough gun plane and ship and many other thing have to be build in the factory and the arsenal of america they have to be produce by worker and manager and engineer with the aid of machine which in turn have to be build by hundred of thousand of worker throughout the land
 in this great work there have be splendid cooperation between the government and industry and labor and i be very thankful
 american industrial genius unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production problem have be call upon to bring its resource and its talent into action manufacturer of watch of farm implement of linotype and cash register and automobile and sewing machine and lawn mower and locomotive be now make fuse bomb pack crates telescope mount shell and pistol and tank
 but all of our present effort be not enough we must have more ship more gun more plane more of everything and this can only be accomplish if we discard the notion of business as usual this job can not be do merely by superimpose on the exist productive facility the add requirement of the nation for defense
 our defense effort must not be block by those who fear the future consequence of surplus plant capacity the possible consequence of failure of our defense effort now be much more to be fear
 and after the present need of our defense be past a proper handling of the country 's peacetime need will require all of the new productive capacity if not still more
 no pessimistic policy about the future of america shall delay the immediate expansion of those industry essential to defense we need they
 i want to make it clear that it be the purpose of the nation to build now with all possible speed every machine every arsenal every and factory that we need to manufacture our defense material we have the man the skill the wealth and above all the will
 i be confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury good in certain industry require the use of machine and raw material that be essential for defense purpose then such production must yield and will gladly yield to our primary and compelling purpose
 so i appeal to the owner of plant to the manager -to the worker to our own government employee to put every ounce of effort into produce these munition swiftly and without stint and with this appeal i give you the pledge that all of we who be officer of your government will devote ourselves to the same whole hearted extent to the great task that which lie ahead
 as plane and ship and gun and shell be produce your government with its defense expert can then determine how good to use they to defend this hemisphere the decision as to how much shall be send abroad and how much shall remain at home must be make on the basis of our overall military necessity
 we must be the great arsenal of democracy for we this be an emergency as serious as war itself we must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution the same sense of urgency the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show be we at war
 we have furnish the british great material support and we will furnish far more in the future there will be no bottleneck in our determination to aid great britain no dictator no combination of dictator will weaken that determination by threat of how they will construe that determination
 the british have receive invaluable military support from the heroic greek army and from the force of all the government in exile their strength be grow it be the strength of man and woman who value their freedom more highly than they value their life
 i believe that the axis power be not go to win this war i base that belief on the late and good of information
 we have no excuse for defeatism we have every good reason for hope hope for peace yes and hope for the defense of our civilization and for the building of a well civilization in the future
 i have the profound conviction that the american people be now determined to put forth a mighty effort than they have ever yet make to increase our production of all the implement of defense to meet the threat to our democratic faith
 as president of the united states i call for that national effort i call for it in the name of this nation which we love and honor and which we be privileged and proud to serve i call upon our people with absolute confidence that our common cause will greatly succeed

mr. president mr. speaker member of the 77th congress

 i address you the member of the 77th congress at a moment unprecedented in the history of the union i use the word unprecedented because at no previous time have american security be as seriously threaten from without as it be today

 since the permanent formation of our government under the constitution in 1789 most of the period of crisis in our history have relate to our domestic affair fortunately only one of these the four year war between the states ever threaten our national unity today thank god 130 million americans in 48 state have forget point of the compass in our national unity

 it be true that prior to 1914 the united states often have be disturb by event in other continent we have even engage in two war with european nation and in a number of undeclared war in the west indies in the mediterranean and in the pacific for the maintenance of american right and for the principle of peaceful commerce but in no case have a serious threat be raise against our national safety or our continued independence

 what i seek to convey be the historic truth that the united states as a nation have at all time maintain clear definite opposition to any attempt to lock we in behind an ancient chinese wall while the procession of civilization go past today think of our child and of their child we oppose enforce isolation for ourselves or for any other part of
 the americas

 that determination of ours extend over all these year be prove for example during the quarter century of war follow the french revolution

 while the napoleonic struggle do threaten interest of the united states because of the french foothold in the west indies and in louisiana and while we engage in the war of 1812 to vindicate our right to peaceful trade it be nevertheless clear that neither france nor great britain nor any other nation be aim at domination of the whole world

 in like fashion from 1815 to 1914—99 year no single war in europe or in asia constitute a real threat against our future or against the future of any other american nation

 except in the maximilian interlude in mexico no foreign power seek to establish itself in this hemisphere and the strength of the british fleet in the atlantic have be a friendly strength it be still a friendly strength

 even when the world war break out in 1914 it seem to contain only small threat of danger to our own american future but as time go on the american people begin to visualize what the downfall of democratic nation might mean to our own democracy

 we need not overemphasize imperfection in the peace of versailles we need not harp on failure of the democracy to deal with problem of world reconstruction we should remember that the peace of 1919 be far less unjust than the kind of pacification which begin even before munich and which be be carry on under the new order of tyranny that seek to spread over every continent today the american people have unalterably set their face against that tyranny

 every realist know that the democratic way of life be at this moment be directly assail in every part of the world assail either by arm or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nation that be still at peace

 during 16 long month this assault have blot out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nation great and small the assailant be still on the march threaten other nation great and small

 therefore as your president perform my constitutional duty to give to the congress information of the state of the union i find it unhappily necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy be overwhelmingly involve in event far beyond our border

 armed defense of democratic existence be now be gallantly wage in four continent if that defense fail all the population and all the resource of europe asia africa and australasia will be dominate by the conqueror let we remember that the total of those population and their resource in those four continent greatly exceed the sum total of the population and the resource of the whole of the western hemisphere many time over

 in time like these it be immature and incidentally untrue for anybody to brag that an unprepared america single handed and with one hand tie behind its back can hold off the whole world

 no realistic american can expect from a dictator 's peace international generosity or return of true independence or world disarmament or freedom of expression or freedom of religion or even good business

 such a peace would bring no security for we or for our neighbor those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety

 as a nation we may take pride in the fact that we be softhearte but we can not afford to be soft headed

 we must always be wary of those who with sound brass and a tinkle cymbal preach the ism of appeasement

 we must especially beware of that small group of selfish man who would clip the wing of the american eagle in order to feather their own nest

 i have recently point out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nation win this war

 there be much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the sea obviously as long as the british navy retain its power no such danger exist even if there be no british navy it be not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack we by land troop in the united states from across thousand of mile of ocean until it have acquire strategic basis from which to operate

 but we learn much from the lesson of the past year in europe particularly the lesson of norway whose essential seaport be capture by treachery and surprise build up over a series of year

 the first phase of the invasion of this hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troop the necessary strategic point would be occupy by secret agent and their dupe and great number of they be already here and in latin america

 as long as the aggressor nation maintain the offensive they not we will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack

 that be why the future of all the american republic be today in serious danger

 that be why this annual message to the congress be unique in our history

 that be why every member of the executive branch of the government and every member of the congress face great responsibility and great accountability

 the need of the moment be that our action and our policy should be devote primarily almost exclusively to meet this foreign peril for all our domestic problem be now a part of the great emergency

 just as our national policy in internal affair have be base upon a decent respect for the right and the dignity of all our fellow man within our gate so our national policy in foreign affair have be base on a decent respect for the right and dignity of all nation large and small and the justice of morality must and will win in the end

 our national policy be this

 first by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship we be commit to all inclusive national defense

 second by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship we be committed to full support of all those resolute people everywhere who be resist aggression and be thereby keep war away from our hemisphere by this support we express our determination that the democratic cause shall prevail and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation

 third by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship we be commit to the proposition that principle of morality and consideration for our own security will never permit we to acquiesce in a peace dictate by aggressor and sponsor by appeaser we know that endure peace can not be buy at the cost of other people 's freedom

 in the recent national election there be no substantial difference between the two great party in respect to that national policy no issue be fight out on this line before the american electorate today it be abundantly evident that american citizen everywhere be demand and support speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger

 therefore the immediate need be a swift and drive increase in our armament production

 leader of industry and labor have respond to our summon goal of speed have be set in some case these goal be be reach ahead of time in some case we be on schedule in other case there be slight but not serious delay and in some case and i be sorry to say very important case we be all concerned by the slowness of the accomplishment of our plan

 the army and navy however have make substantial progress during the past year actual experience be improve and speed up our method of production with every pass day and today 's good be not good enough for tomorrow

 i be not satisfied with the progress thus far make the man in charge of the program represent the good in training in ability and in patriotism they be not satisfied with the progress thus far make none of we will be satisfied until the job be do

 no matter whether the original goal be set too high or too low our objective be quick and well result to give you two illustration

 we be behind schedule in turn out finished airplane we be work day and night to solve the innumerable problem and to catch up

 we be ahead of schedule in build warship but we be work to get even far ahead of that schedule

 to change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implement of peace to a basis of wartime production of implement of war be no small task and the great difficulty come at the beginning of the program when new tool new plant facility new assembly line and new ship way must first be construct before the actual materiel begin to flow steadily and speedily from they

 the congress of course must rightly keep itself inform at all time of the progress of the program however there be certain information as the congress itself will readily recognize which in the interest of our own security and those of the nation that we be support must of need be keep in confidence

 new circumstance be constantly beget new need for our safety i shall ask this congress for greatly increase new appropriation and authorization to carry on what we have begin

 i also ask this congress for authority and for fund sufficient to manufacture additional munition and war supply of many kind to be turn over to those nation which be now in actual war with aggressor nation

 our most useful and immediate role be to act as an arsenal for they as well as for ourselves they do not need man power but they do need billion of dollar worth of the weapon of defense

 the time be near when they will not be able to pay for they all in ready cash we can not and we will not tell they that they must surrender merely because of present inability to pay for the weapon which we know they must have

 i do not recommend that we make they a loan of dollar with which to pay for these weapon a loan to be repay in dollar

 i recommend that we make it possible for those nation to continue to obtain war material in the united states fit their order into our own program nearly all their materiel would if the time ever come be useful for our own defense

 take counsel of expert military and naval authority consider what be good for our own security we be free to decide how much should be keep here and how much should be send abroad to our friend who by their determined and heroic resistance be give we time in which to make ready our own defense

 for what we send abroad we shall be repay within a reasonable time follow the close of hostility in similar material or at our option in other good of many kind which they can produce and which we need

 let we say to the democracy we americans be vitally concerned in your defense of freedom we be put forth our energy our resource and our organize power to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world we shall send you in ever increase number ship plane tank gun this be our purpose and our pledge

 in fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidate by the threat of dictator that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracy which dare to resist their aggression such aid be not an act of war even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be

 when the dictator if the dictator be ready to make war upon we they will not wait for an act of war on our part they do not wait for norway or belgium or the netherlands to commit an act of war

 their only interest be in a new one way international law which lack mutuality in its observance and therefore become an instrument of oppression

 the happiness of future generation of americans may well depend upon how effective and how immediate we can make our aid feel no one can tell the exact character of the emergency situation that we may be call upon to meet the nation 's hand must not be tie when the nation 's life be in danger

 we must all prepare to make the sacrifice that the emergency almost as serious as war itself demand whatever stand in the way of speed and efficiency in defense preparation must give way to the national need

 a free nation have the right to expect full cooperation from all group a free nation have the right to look to the leader of business of labor and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort not among other group but within their own group

 the good way of deal with the few slacker or trouble maker in our midst be first to shame they by patriotic example and if that fail to use the sovereignty of government to save government

 as man do not live by bread alone they do not fight by armament alone those who man our defense and those behind they who build our defense must have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which they be defend the mighty action that we be call for can not be base on a disregard of all thing worth fight for

 the nation take great satisfaction and much strength from the thing which have be do to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in america those thing have toughen the fibre of our people have renew their faith and strengthen their devotion to the institution we make ready to protect

 certainly this be no time for any of we to stop think about the social and economic problem which be the root cause of the social revolution which be today a supreme factor in the world

 for there be nothing mysterious about the foundation of a healthy and strong democracy the basic thing expect by our people of their political and economic system be simple they be

 equality of opportunity for youth and for other

 job for those who can work

 security for those who need it

 the ending of special privilege for the few

 the preservation of civil liberty for all

 the enjoyment of the fruit of scientific progress in a wide and constantly rise standard of living

 these be the simple basic thing that must never be lose sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world the inner and abide strength of our economic and political system be dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectation

 many subject connect with our social economy call for immediate improvement as example

 we should bring more citizen under the coverage of old age pension and unemployment insurance

 we should widen the opportunity for adequate medical care

 we should plan a well system by which person deserve or need gainful employment may obtain it

 i have call for personal sacrifice i be assure of the willingness of almost all americans to respond to that call

 a part of the sacrifice mean the payment of more money in taxis in my budget message i shall recommend that a great portion of this great defense program be pay for from taxation than we be pay today no person should try or be allow to get rich out of this program and the principle of tax payment in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eye to guide our legislation

 if the congress maintain these principle the voter put patriotism ahead of pocketbook will give you their applause

 in the future day which we seek to make secure we look forward to a world found upon four essential human freedom

 the first be freedom of speech and expression everywhere in the world

 the second be freedom of every person to worship god in his own way everywhere in the world

 the third be freedom from want which translate into world term mean economic understanding which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitant everywhere in the world

 the fourth be freedom from fear which translate into world term mean a world wide reduction of armament to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor anywhere in the world

 that be no vision of a distant millennium it be a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation that kind of world be the very antithesis of the so call new order of tyranny which the dictator seek to create with the crash of a bomb

 to that new order we oppose the great conception the moral order a good society be able to face scheme of world domination and foreign revolution alike without fear

 since the beginning of our american history we have be engage in change in a perpetual peaceful revolution a revolution which go on steadily quietly adjust itself to change condition without the concentration camp or the quick lime in the ditch the world order which we seek be the cooperation of free country work together in a friendly civilized society

 this nation have place its destiny in the hand and head and heart of its million of free man and woman and its faith in freedom under the guidance of god freedom mean the supremacy of human right everywhere our support go to those who struggle to gain those right or keep they our strength be our unity of purpose to that high concept there can be no end save victory

on each national day of inauguration since 1789 the people have renew their sense of dedication to the united states

 in washington 's day the task of the people be to create and weld together a nation

 in lincoln 's day the task of the people be to preserve that nation from disruption from within

 in this day the task of the people be to save that nation and its institution from disruption from without

 to we there have come a time in the midst of swift happening to pause for a moment and take stock to recall what our place in history have be and to rediscover what we be and what we may be if we do not we risk the real peril of isolation the real peril of inaction

 life of nations be determined not by the count of year but by the lifetime of the human spirit the life of a man be threescore year and ten a little more a little less the life of a nation be the fullness of the measure of its will to live

 there be man who doubt this there be man who believe that democracy as a form of government and a frame of life be limited or measure by a kind of mystical and artificial fate that for some unexplained reason tyranny and slavery have become the surge wave of the future and that freedom be an ebb tide

 but we americans know that this be not true

 eight year ago when the life of this republic seem frozen by a fatalistic terror we prove that this be not true we be in the midst of shock but we act we act quickly boldly decisively

 these later year have be live year fruitful year for the people of this democracy for they have bring to we great security and i hope a well understanding that life 's ideal be to be measure in other than material thing

 most vital to our present and to our future be this experience of a democracy which successfully survive crisis at home put away many evil thing build new structure on endure line and through it all maintain the fact of its democracy

 for action have be take within the three way framework of the constitution of the united states the coordinate branch of the government continue freely to function the bill of rights remain inviolate the freedom of election be wholly maintain prophet of the downfall of american democracy have see their dire prediction come to naught

 no democracy be not die

 we know it because we have see it revive and grow

 we know it can not die because it be build on the unhampere
 initiative of individual man and woman join together in a common
 enterprise an enterprise undertake and carry through by the free expression of a free majority

 we know it because democracy alone of all form of government enlist the full force of man 's enlightened will

 we know it because democracy alone have construct an unlimited civilization capable of infinite progress in the improvement of human life

 we know it because if we look below the surface we sense it still spread on every continent for it be the most humane the most advanced and in the end the most unconquerable of all form of human society

 a nation like a person have a body a body that must be feed and clothe and house invigorate and rest in a manner that measure up to the standard of our time

 a nation like a person have a mind a mind that must be keep inform and alert that must know itself that understand the hope and the need of its neighbor all the other nations that live within the narrow circle of the world

 a nation like a person have something deep something more permanent something large than the sum of all its part it be that something which matter most to its future which call forth the most sacred guarding of its present

 it be a thing for which we find it difficult even impossible to hit upon a single simple word

 and yet we all understand what it be the spirit the faith of america it be the product of century it be bear in the multitude of those who come from many land some of high degree but mostly plain people who seek here early and late to find freedom more freely

 the democratic aspiration be no mere recent phase in human history it be human history it permeate the ancient life of early people it blaze anew in the middle ages it be write in magna charta

 in the americas its impact have be irresistible america have be the new world in all tongue and to all people not because this continent be a new find land but because all those who come here believe they could create upon this continent a new life a life that should be new in freedom

 its vitality be write into our own mayflower compact into the declaration of independence into the constitution of the united states into the gettysburg address

 those who first come here to carry out the longing of their spirit and the million who follow and the stock that spring from they all have move forward constantly and consistently toward an ideal which in itself have gain stature and clarity with each generation

 the hope of the republic can not forever tolerate either undeserved poverty or self serve wealth

 we know that we still have far to go that we must more greatly build the security and the opportunity and the knowledge of every citizen in the measure justify by the resource and the capacity of the land

 but it be not enough to achieve these purpose alone it be not enough to clothe and feed the body of this nation to instruct and inform its mind for there be also the spirit and of the three the great be the spirit

 without the body and the mind as all man know the nation could not live

 but if the spirit of america be kill even though the nation 's body and mind constrict in an alien world live on the america we know would have perish

 that spirit that faith speak to we in our daily life in way often unnoticed because they seem so obvious it speak to we here in the capital of the nation it speak to we through the process of govern in the sovereignty of 48 states it speak to we in our county in our city in our town and in our village it speak to we from the other nations of the hemisphere and from those across the sea the enslaved as well as the free sometimes we fail to hear or heed these voice of freedom because to we the privilege of our freedom be such an old old story

 the destiny of america be proclaim in word of prophecy speak by our first president in his first inaugural in 1789 word almost direct it
 would seem to this year of 1941 the preservation of the sacred fire of
 liberty and the destiny of the republican model of government be justly
 consider deeply finally stake on the experiment intrust to
 the hand of the american people

 if you and i in this later day lose that sacred fire if we let it be smother with doubt and fear then we shall reject the destiny which washington strove so valiantly and so triumphantly to establish the preservation of the spirit and faith of the nation do and will furnish the high justification for every sacrifice that we may make in the cause of national defense

 in the face of great peril never before encounter our strong purpose be to protect and to perpetuate the integrity of democracy

 for this we muster the spirit of america and the faith of america

 we do not retreat we be not content to stand still as americans we go forward in the service of our country by the will of god

this dinner of the white house correspondents association be unique it be the first one at which i have make a speech in all these eight year it differ from the press conference that you and i hold twice a week for you can not ask i any question tonight and everything that i have to say be word for word on the record

 for eight year you and i have be help each other i have be try to keep you informed of the news of washington of the nation and of the world from the point of view of the presidency you more than you realize have be give i a great deal of information about what the people of this country be think and say

 in our press conference as at this dinner tonight we include reporter represent paper and news agency of many other land to most of they it be a matter of constant amazement that press conference such as ours can exist in any nation in the world

 that be especially true in those land where freedom do not exist where the purpose of our democracy and the characteristic of our country and of our people have be seriously distort

 such misunderstanding be not new i remember that a quarter of a century ago in the early day of the first world war the german government receive solemn assurance from their representative in the united states that the people of america be disunite that they care more for peace at any price than for the preservation of ideal and freedom that there would even be riot and revolution in the united states if this nation ever assert its own interest

 let not dictator of europe or asia doubt our unanimity now before the present war break out on september 1 1939 i be more worried about the future than many people indeed than most people the record show that i be not worried enough

 that however be water over the dam do not let we waste time in review the past or fix or dodge the blame for it history can not be rewrite by wishful thinking we the american people be write new history today

 the big news story of this week be this the world have be tell that we as a united nation realize the danger that confront we and that to meet that danger our democracy have go into action

 we know that although prussian autocracy be bad enough in the first war nazism be far bad in this

 nazi force be not seek mere modification in colonial map or in minor european boundary they openly seek the destruction of all elective system of government on every continent include our own they seek to establish system of government base on the regimentation of all human being by a handful of individual ruler who have seize power by force

 yes these man and their hypnotized follower call this a new order it be not new and it be not order for order among nations presuppose something endure some system of justice under which individual over a long period of time be willing to live humanity will never permanently accept a system impose by conquest and base on slavery

 these modern tyrant find it necessary to their plan to eliminate all democracy eliminate they one by one the nations of europe and indeed we ourselves do not appreciate that purpose we do now the process of the elimination of the european nations proceed accord to plan through 1939 and well into 1940 until the schedule be shoot to piece by the unbeatable defender of britain

 the enemy of democracy be wrong in their calculation for a very simple reason they be wrong because they believe that democracy could not adjust itself to the terrible reality of a world at war

 they believe that democracy because of its profound respect for the right of man would never arm itself to fight

 they believe that democracy because of its will to live at peace with its neighbor could not mobilize its energy even in its own defense

 they know now that democracy can still remain democracy and speak and reach conclusion and arm itself adequately for defense

 from the bureaus of propaganda of the axis power come the confident prophecy that the conquest of our country would be an inside job"—a job accomplish not by overpower invasion from without but by disrupt confusion and disunion and moral disintegration from within

 those who believe that know little of our history america be not a country which can be confound by the appeaser the defeatist the backstair manufacturer of panic it be a country that talk out its problem in the open where any man can hear they

 we have just now engage in a great debate it be not limit to the hall of congress it be argue in every newspaper on every wave length over every cracker barrel in all the land and it be finally settle and decide by the american people themselves

 yes the decision of our democracy may be slowly arrive at but when that decision be make it be proclaim not with the voice of any one man but with the voice of one hundred and thirty million it be bind on we all and the world be no long leave in doubt

 this decision be the end of any attempt at appeasement in our land the end of urge we to get along with dictator the end of compromise with tyranny and the force of oppression

 and the urgency be now

 we believe firmly that when our production output be in full swing the democracy of the world will be able to prove that dictatorship can not win

 but now now the time element be of supreme importance every plane every other instrument of war old and new every instrument that we can spare now we will send overseas because that be the common sense of strategy

 the great task of this day the deep duty that rest upon each and every one of we be to move product from the assembly line of our factory to the battle line of democracy now

 we can have speed we can have effectiveness if we maintain our exist unity we do not have and never will have the false unity of a people browbeat by threat mislead by propaganda ours be a unity that be possible only among free man and woman who recognize the truth and face reality with intelligence and courage

 today at last today at long last ours be not a partial effort it be a total effort and that be the only way to guarantee ultimate safety

 begin a year ago we start the erection of hundred of plant we start the training of million of man

 then at the moment that the aid to democracy bill be pass this week we be ready to recommend the seven billion dollar appropriation on the basis of capacity production as now plan

 the article themselves cover the whole range of munition of war and of the facility for transport they across the sea

 the aid to democracy bill be agree on by both house of the congress last tuesday afternoon i sign it one half hour later five minute after that i approve a list of article for immediate shipment and today saturday night many of they be on their way on wednesday i recommend an appropriation for new material to the extent of seven billion dollar and the congress be make patriotic speed in make the money available

 here in washington we be think in term of speed and speed now and i hope that that watchword—"speed and speed now"—will find its way into every home in the nation

 we shall have to make sacrifice every one of we the final extent of those sacrifice will depend on the speed with which we act now

 i must tell you tonight in plain language what this undertaking mean to you to you in your daily life

 whether you be in the armed service whether you be a steel worker or a stevedore a machinist or a housewife a farmer or a banker a storekeeper or a manufacturer to all of you it will mean sacrifice in behalf of your country and your liberty yes you will feel the impact of this gigantic effort in your daily life you will feel it in a way that will cause to you many inconvenience

 you will have to be content with low profit low profit from business because obviously your taxis will be high

 you will have to work long at your bench or your plow or your machine or your desk

 let i make it clear that the nation be call for the sacrifice of some privilege not for the sacrifice of fundamental right and most of we will do it willingly that kind of sacrifice be for the common national protection and welfare for our defense against the most ruthless brutality in all history for the ultimate victory of a way of life now so violently menace

 a halfhearted effort on our part will lead to failure this be no part time job the concept of business as usual of normalcy must be forget until the task be finish yes it be an all out effort and nothing short of an all out effort will win

 therefore we be dedicate from here on to a constantly increase tempo of production a production great than we now know or have ever know before a production that do not stop and should not pause

 tonight i be appeal to the heart and to the mind of every man and every woman within our border who love liberty i ask you to consider the need of our nation and this hour to put aside all personal difference until the victory be win

 the light of democracy must be keep burn to the perpetuation of this light each of we must do his own share the single effort of one individual may seem very small but there be 130 million individual overhere and there be many more million in britain and elsewhere bravely shield the great flame of democracy from the blackout of barbarism it be not enough for we merely to trim the wick or polish the glass the time have come when we must provide the fuel in ever increase amount to keep that flame alight

 there will be no division of party or section or race or nationality or religion there be not one among we who do not have a stake in the outcome of the effort in which we be now engage

 a few week ago i speak of four freedom freedom of speech and expression freedom of every person to worship god in his own way freedom from want freedom from fear they be the ultimate stake they may not be immediately attainable throughout the world but humanity do move toward those glorious ideal through democratic process and if we fail if democracy be supersede by slavery then those four freedom or even the mention of they will become forbid thing century will pass before they can be revive

 by win now we strengthen the meaning of those freedom we increase the stature of mankind we establish the dignity of human life

 i have often think that there be a vast difference between the word loyalty and the word obedience obedience can be obtain and enforce in a dictatorship by the use of threat or extortion or blackmail or it can be obtain by a failure on the part of government to tell the truth to its citizen

 loyalty be different it spring from the mind that be give the fact that retain ancient ideal and proceed without coercion to give support to its own government

 that be true in england and in greece and in china and in the united states today and in many other country million of man and woman be pray for the return of a day when they can give that kind of loyalty

 loyalty can not be buy dollar alone will not win this war let we not delude ourselves as to that

 today nearly a million and a half american citizen be hard at work in our armed force the spirit the determination of these man of our army and navy be worthy of the high tradition of our country no well man ever serve under washington or john paul jones or grant or lee or pershing that be a boast i admit but it be not an idle one

 upon the national will to sacrifice and to work depend the output of our industry and our agriculture

 upon that will depend the survival of the vital bridge across the ocean the bridge of ship that carry the arm and the food for those who be fight the good fight

 upon that will depend our ability to aid other nation which may determine to offer resistance

 upon that will may depend practical assistance to people now live in nations that have be overrun should they find the opportunity to strike back in an effort to regain their liberty and may that day come soon

 this will of the american people will not be frustrate either by threat from powerful enemy abroad or by small selfish group or individual at home

 the determination of america must not and will not be obstruct by war profiteer

 it must not be obstruct by unnecessary strike of worker by shortsighted management or by the third danger deliberate sabotage

 for unless we win there will be no freedom for either management or labor

 wise labor leader and wise business manager will realize how necessary it be to their own existence to make common sacrifice for this great common cause

 there be no long the slight question or doubt that the american people recognize the extreme seriousness of the present situation that be why they have demand and get a policy of unqualified immediate all out aid for britain for greece for china and for all the government in exile whose homeland be temporarily occupy by the aggressor

 and from now on that aid will be increase and yet again increase until total victory have be win

 the british be strong than ever in the magnificent morale that have enable they to endure all the dark day and the shattered night of the past ten month they have the full support and help of canada of the other dominions of the rest of their empire and the full aid and support of non british people throughout the world who still think in term of the great freedom

 the british people be brace for invasion whenever such attempt may come tomorrow next week next month

 in this historic crisis britain be bless with a brilliant and great leader in winston churchill but know he no one know well than mr. churchill himself that it be not alone his stir word and valiant deed that give the british their superb morale the essence of that morale be in the masse of plain people who be completely clear in their mind about the one essential fact that they would rather die as free man than live as slave

 these plain people civilian as well as soldier and sailor and
 airman woman and girl as well as man and boy they be fight in the front line of civilization at this moment and they be hold that line with a fortitude that will forever be the pride and the inspiration of all free man on every continent on every isle of the sea

 the british people and their grecian ally need ship from america they will get ship

 they need plane from america they will get plane

 from america they need food from america they will get food

 they need tank and gun and ammunition and supply of all kind from america they will get tank and gun and ammunition and supply of all kind

 china likewise express the magnificent will of million of plain people to resist the dismemberment of their historic nation china through the generalissimo chiang kai shek ask our help america have say that china shall have our help

 and so our country be go to be what our people have proclaim it must be the arsenal of democracy

 our country be go to play its full part

 and when no i do not say if i say when dictatorship disintegrate and pray god that will be soon than any of we now dare to hope then our country must continue to play its great part in the period of world reconstruction for the good of humanity

 we believe that the rally cry of the dictator their boasting about a master race will prove to be pure stuff and nonsense there never have be there be not now and there never will be any race of people on the earth fit to serve as master over their fellow man

 the world have no use for any nation which because of size or because of military might assert the right to goosestep to world power over the body of other nation or other race we believe that any nationality no matter how small have the inherent right to its own nationhood

 we believe that the man and woman of such nation no matter what size can through the process of peace serve themselves and serve the world by protect the common man 's security improve the standard of healthful living provide market for manufacture and for agriculture through that kind of peaceful service every nation can increase its happiness banish the terror of war and abandon man 's inhumanity to man

 never in all our history have americans face a job so well worth while may it be say of we in the day to come that our child and our child 's child rise up and call we bless

i be speak tonight from the white house in the presence of the governing board of the pan american union the canadian minister and their family the member of this board be the ambassadors and ministers of the american republics in washington it be appropriate that i do this for now as never before the unity of the american republics be of supreme importance to each and every one of we and to the cause of freedom throughout the world our future independence be bind up with the future independence of all of our sister republics

 the press problem that confront we be military and naval problem we can not afford to approach they from the point of view of wishful thinker or sentimentalist what we face be cold hard fact

 the first and fundamental fact be that what start as a european war have develop as the nazis always intend it should develop into a world war for world domination

 adolf hitler never consider the domination of europe as an end in itself european conquest be but a step toward ultimate goal in all the other continent it be unmistakably apparent to all of we that unless the advance of hitlerism be forcibly check now the western hemisphere will be within range of the nazi weapon of destruction

 for our own defense we have accordingly undertake certain obviously necessary measure

 first we have join in conclude a series of agreement with all the other american republics this far solidify our hemisphere against the common danger

 and then a year ago we launch and be successfully carry out the large armament production program we have ever undertake

 we have add substantially to our splendid navy and we have muster our manpower to build up a new army which be already worthy of the high tradition of our military service

 we institute a policy of aid for the democracy the nation which have fight for the continuation of human liberty

 this policy have its origin in the first month of the war when i urge upon the congress repeal of the arm embargo provision in the old neutrality law and in that message of september 3 1939 i say i should like to be able to offer the hope that the shadow over the world might swiftly pass i can not the fact compel my stating with candor that dark period may lie ahead

 in the subsequent month the shadow deepen and lengthen and the night spread over poland denmark norway holland belgium luxembourg and france

 in june 1940 britain stand alone face by the same machine of terror which have overwhelm her ally our government rush arm to meet her desperate need

 in september 1940 an agreement be complete with great britain for the trade of fifty destroyer for eight important offshore basis

 and in march 1941 the congress pass the lend lease bill and an appropriation of seven billion dollar to implement it this law realistically provide for material aid for the government of any country whose defense the president deem vital to the defense of the united states

 our whole program of aid for the democracy have be base on hard headed concern for our own security and for the kind of safe and civilized world in which we wish to live every dollar of material that we send help to keep the dictator away from our own hemisphere and every day that they be hold off give we time to build more gun and tank and plane and ship

 we have make no pretense about our own self interest in this aid great britain understand it and so do nazi germany

 and now after a year britain still fight gallantly on a far fling battle line we have double and redouble our vast production increase month by month our material supply of the tool of war for ourselves and for britain and for china and eventually for all the democracy

 the supply of these tool will not fail it will increase

 with greatly augmented strength the united states and the other american republics now chart their course in the situation of today

 your government know what term hitler if victorious would impose they be indeed the only term on which he would accept a so call negotiate peace

 and under those term germany would literally parcel out the world hoist the swastika itself over vast territory and population and set up puppet government of its own choosing wholly subject to the will and the policy of a conqueror

 to the people of the americas a triumphant hitler would say as he say after the seizure of austria and as he say after munich and as he say after the seizure of czechoslovakia i be now completely satisfied this be the last territorial readjustment i will seek and he would of course add all we want be peace friendship and profitable trade relation with you in the new world

 be any of we in the americas so incredibly simple and forgetful as to accept those honey word what would then happen

 those in the new world who be seek profit would be urge that all that the dictatorship desire be peace they would oppose toil and taxis for more american armament and meanwhile the dictatorship would be force the enslaved people of their old world conquest into a system they be even now organize to build a naval and air force intend to gain and hold and be master of the atlantic and the pacific as well

 they would fasten an economic stranglehold upon our several nation quisling would be find to subvert the government in our republic and the nazis would back their fifth column with invasion if necessary

 no i be not speculate about all this i merely repeat what be already in the nazi book of world conquest they plan to treat the latin american nations as they be now treat the balkans they plan then to strangle the united states of america and the dominion of canada

 the american laborer would have to compete with slave labor in the rest of the world minimum wage maximum hour nonsense wage and hour would be fix by hitler the dignity and power and standard of living of the american worker and farmer would be go trade union would become historical relic and collective bargaining a joke

 farm income what happen to all farm surplus without any foreign trade the american farmer would get for his product exactly what hitler want to give the farmer would face obvious disaster and complete regimentation

 tariff wall chinese wall of isolation would be futile freedom to trade be essential to our economic life we do not eat all the food we can produce and we do not burn all the oil we can pump we do not use all the good we can manufacture it would not be an american wall to keep nazi good out it would be a nazi wall to keep we in

 the whole fabric of work life as we know it business and manufacturing mining and agriculture all would be mangle and cripple under such a system yet to maintain even that crippled independence would require permanent conscription of our manpower it would curtail the fund we could spend on education on housing on public work on flood control on health and instead we should be permanently pour our resource into armament and year in and year out stand day and night watch against the destruction of our city

 yes even our right of worship would be threaten the nazi world do not recognize any god except hitler for the nazis be as ruthless as the communists in the denial of god what place have religion which preach the dignity of the human being the majesty of the human soul in a world where moral standard be measure by treachery and bribery and fifth columnist will our child too wander off goose step in search of new god

 we do not accept we will not permit this nazi shape of thing to come it will never be force upon we if we act in this present crisis with the wisdom and the courage which have distinguish our country in all the crisis of the past

 today the nazis have take military possession of the great part of europe in africa they have occupy tripoli and libya and they be threaten egypt the suez canal and the near east but their plan do not stop there for the indian ocean be the gateway to the farth east

 they also have the armed power at any moment to occupy spain and portugal and that threat extend not only to french north africa and the western end of the mediterranean but it extend also to the atlantic fortress of dakar and to the island outpost of the new world the azores and cape verde islands

 the cape verde islands be only seven hour distance from brazil by bomber or troop carry plane they dominate shipping route to and from the south atlantic

 the war be approach the brink of the western hemisphere itself it be come very close to home

 control or occupation by nazi force of any of the island of the atlantic would jeopardize the immediate safety of portion of north and south america and of the island possession of the united states and therefore the ultimate safety of the continental united states itself

 hitler 's plan of world domination would be near its accomplishment today be it not for two factor one be the epic resistance of britain her colony and the great dominion fight not only to maintain the existence of the island of britain but also to hold the near east and africa the other be the magnificent defense of china which will i have reason to believe increase in strength all of these together be prevent the axis from win control of the sea by ship and aircraft

 the axis powers can never achieve their objective of world domination unless they first obtain control of the sea that be their supreme purpose today and to achieve it they must capture great britain

 they could then have the power to dictate to the western hemisphere no spurious argument no appeal to sentiment no false pledge like those give by hitler at munich can deceive the american people into believe that he and his axis partner would not with britain defeat close in relentlessly on this hemisphere of our

 but if the axis powers fail to gain control of the sea then they be certainly defeat their dream of world domination will then go by the board and the criminal leader who start this war will suffer inevitable disaster

 both they and their people know this- and they and their people be afraid that be why they be risk everything they have conduct desperate attempt to break through to the command of the ocean once they be limit to a continue land war their cruel force of occupation will be unable to keep their heel on the neck of the million of innocent oppress people on the continent of europe and in the end their whole structure will break into little piece and let we remember the wide the nazi land effort the great be their ultimate danger

 we do not forget the silence people the master of germany have mark these silence people and their child 's child for slavery those at least who have not be assassinate or escape to free soil but those people spiritually unconquered austrians czechs poles norwegians dutch belgians frenchmen greeks southern slavs yes even those italians and germans who themselves have be enslave will prove to be a powerful force in the final disruption of the nazi system

 all freedom mean freedom to live and not freedom to conquer and subjugate other people depend on freedom of the sea all of american history north central and south american history have be inevitably tie up with those word freedom of the sea

 since 1799 142 year ago when our infant navy make the west indies and the caribbean and the gulf of mexico safe for american ship since 1804 and 1805 when we make all peaceful commerce safe from the depredation of the barbary pirate since the war of 1812 which be fight for the preservation of sailor right since 1867 when our sea power make it possible for the mexicans to expel the french army of louis napoleon we have strive and fight in defense of freedom of the sea for our own shipping for the commerce of our sister republics for the right of all nation to use the highway of world trade and for our own safety

 during the first world war we be able to escort merchant ship by the use of small cruiser gunboat and destroyer and that type call a convoy be effective against submarine in this second world war however the problem be great it be different because the attack on the freedom of the sea be now fourfold first the improved submarine second the much great use of the heavily armed raid cruiser or the hit and run battleship third the bombing airplane which be capable of destroy merchant ship seven or eight hundred mile from its near base and fourth the destruction of merchant ship in those port of the world that be accessible to bombing attack

 the battle of the atlantic now extend from the icy water of the north pole to the frozen continent of the antarctic throughout this huge area there have be sinking of merchant ship in alarming and increase number by nazi raider or submarine there have be sinking even of ship carry neutral flag there have be sinking in the south atlantic off west africa and the cape verde islands between the azores and the island off the american coast and between greenland and iceland great number of these sinking have be actually within the water of the western hemisphere itself

 the blunt truth be this and i reveal this with the full knowledge of the british government the present rate of nazi sinking of merchant ship be more than three time as high as the capacity of british shipyard to replace they it be more than twice the combine british and american output of merchant ship today

 we can answer this peril by two simultaneous measure first by speed up and increase our own great shipbuilding program and second by help to cut down the loss on the high sea

 attack on ship off the very shore of land which we be determined to protect present an actual military danger to the americas and that danger have recently be heavily underline by the presence in western hemisphere water of a nazi battleship of great striking power

 you remember that most of the supply for britain go by a northerly route which come close to greenland and the nearby island of iceland germany 's heavy attack be on that route nazi occupation of iceland or basis in greenland would bring the war close to our own continental shore because those place be step stone to labrador and newfoundland to nova scotia yes to the northern united states itself include the great industrial center of the north the east and the middle west

 equally the azores and the cape verde islands if occupy or control by germany would directly endanger the freedom of the atlantic and our own american physical safety under german domination those island would become basis for submarine warship and airplane raid the water that lie immediately off our own coast and attack the shipping in the south atlantic they would provide a springboard for actual attack against the integrity and the independence of brazil and her neighboring republic

 i have say on many occasion that the united states be muster its man and its resource only for purpose of defense- only to repel attack i repeat that statement now but we must be realistic when we use the word attack we have to relate it to the lightning speed of modern warfare

 some people seem to think that we be not attack until bomb actually drop in the street of new york or san francisco or new orleans or chicago but they be simply shut their eye to the lesson that we must learn from the fate of every nation that the nazis have conquer

 the attack on czechoslovakia begin with the conquest of austria the attack on norway begin with the occupation of denmark the attack on greece begin with occupation of albania and bulgaria the attack on the suez canal begin with the invasion of the balkans and north africa and the attack on the united states can begin with the domination of any base which menace our security north or south

 nobody can foretell tonight just when the act of the dictator will ripen into attack on this hemisphere and we but we know enough by now to realize that it would be suicide to wait until they be in our front yard

 when your enemy come at you in a tank or a bombing plane if you hold your fire until you see the white of his eye you will never know what hit you our bunker hill of tomorrow may be several thousand mile from boston

 anyone with an atlas anyone with a reasonable knowledge of the sudden striking force of modern war know that it be stupid to wait until a probable enemy have gain a foothold from which to attack old fashioned common sense call for the use of a strategy that will prevent such an enemy from gain a foothold in the first place

 we have accordingly extend our patrol in north and south atlantic water we be steadily add more and more ship and plane to that patrol it be well know that the strength of the atlantic fleet have be greatly increase during the past year and that it be constantly be build up

 these ship and plane warn of the presence of attack raider on the sea under the sea and above the sea the danger from these raider be of course greatly lessen if their location be definitely know we be thus be forewarn we shall be on our guard against effort to establish nazi basis close to our hemisphere

 the deadly fact of war compel nation for simple self preservation to make stern choice it do not make sense for instance to say i believe in the defense of all the western hemisphere and in the next breath to say i will not fight for that defense until the enemy have land on our shore if we believe in the independence and the integrity of the americas we must be willing to fight to fight to defend they just as much as we would to fight for the safety of our own home

 it be time for we to realize that the safety of american home even in the center of this our own country have a very definite relationship to the continued safety of home in nova scotia or trinidad or brazil

 our national policy today therefore be this

 first we shall actively resist wherever necessary and with all our resource every attempt by hitler to extend his nazi domination to the western hemisphere or to threaten it we shall actively resist his every attempt to gain control of the sea we insist upon the vital importance of keep hitlerism away from any point in the world which could be use or would be use as a base of attack against the americas

 second from the point of view of strict naval and military necessity we shall give every possible assistance to britain and to all who with britain be resist hitlerism or its equivalent with force of arm our patrol be help now to insure delivery of the need supply to britain all additional measure necessary to deliver the good will be take any and all further method or combination of method which can or should be utilize be be devise by our military and naval technician who with i will work out and put into effect such new and additional safeguard as may be need

 i say that the delivery of need supply to britain be imperative i say that this can be do it must be do and it will be do

 to the other american nations twenty republic and the dominion of canada i say this the united states do not merely propose these purpose but be actively engage today in carry they out

 i say to they far you may disregard those few citizen of the united states who contend that we be disunite and can not act

 there be some timid one among we who say that we must preserve peace at any price lest we lose our liberty forever

 to they i say this never in the history of the world have a nation lose its democracy by a successful struggle to defend its democracy we must not be defeat by the fear of the very danger which we be prepare to resist our freedom have show its ability to survive war but our freedom would never survive surrender the only thing we have to fear be fear itself

 there be of course a small group of sincere patriotic man and woman whose real passion for peace have shut their eye to the ugly reality of international banditry and to the need to resist it at all cost i be sure they be embarrassed by the sinister support they be receive from the enemy of democracy in our midst the bundists the fascists and communists and every group devote to bigotry and racial and religious intolerance it be no mere coincidence that all the argument put forward by these enemy of democracy all their attempt to confuse and divide our people and to destroy public confidence in our government all their defeatist foreboding that britain and democracy be already beat all their selfish promise that we can do business with hitler all of these be but echo of the word that have be pour out from the axis bureaus of propaganda those same word have be use before in other country to scare they to divide they to soften they up invariably those same word have form the advance guard of physical attack

 your government have the right to expect of all citizen that they take part in the common work of our common defense take loyal part from this moment forward

 i have recently set up the machinery for civilian defense it will rapidly organize locality by locality it will depend on the organized effort of man and woman everywhere all will have opportunity and responsibility to fulfill

 defense today mean more than merely fight it mean morale civilian as well as military it mean use every available resource it mean enlarge every useful plant it mean the use of a great american common sense in discard rumor and distorted statement it mean recognize for what they be racketeer and fifth columnist who be the incendiary bomb in this country of the moment

 all of we know that we have make very great social progress in recent year we propose to maintain that progress and strengthen it when the nation be threaten from without however as it be today the actual production and transportation of the machinery of defense must not be interrupt by dispute between capital and capital labor and labor or capital and labor the future of all free enterprise of capital and labor alike be at stake

 this be no time for capital to make or be allow to retain excess profit article of defense must have undisputed right of way in every industrial plant in the country

 a nation wide machinery for conciliation and mediation of industrial dispute have be set up that machinery must be use promptly and without stoppage of work collective bargaining will be retain but the american people expect that impartial recommendation of our government conciliation and mediation service will be follow both by capital and by labor

 the overwhelming majority of our citizen expect their government to see that the tool of defense be build and for the very purpose of preserve the democratic safeguard of both labor and management this government be determined to use all of its power to express the will of its people and to prevent interference with the production of material essential to our nation 's security

 today the whole world be divide between human slavery and human freedom between pagan brutality and the christian ideal

 we choose human freedom which be the christian ideal

 no one of we can waver for a moment in his courage or his faith

 we will not accept a hitler dominate world and we will not accept a world like the postwar world of the 1920s in which the seed of hitlerism can again be plant and allow to grow

 we will accept only a world consecrate to freedom of speech and expression freedom of every person to worship god in his own way freedom from want and freedom from terror

 be such a world impossible of attainment

 magna charta the declaration of independence the constitution of the united states the emancipation proclamation and every other milestone in human progress all be ideal which seem impossible of attainment and yet they be attain

 as a military force we be weak when we establish our independence but we successfully stand off tyrant powerful in their day tyrant who be now lose in the dust of history

 odd mean nothing to we then shall we now with all our potential strength hesitate to take every single measure necessary to maintain our american liberty

 our people and our government will not hesitate to meet that challenge

 as the president of a united and determined people i say solemnly

 we reassert the ancient american doctrine of freedom of the sea

 we reassert the solidarity of the twenty one american republics and the dominion of canada in the preservation of the independence of the hemisphere

 we have pledge material support to the other democracy of the world and we will fulfill that pledge

 we in the americas will decide for ourselves whether and when and where our american interest be attack or our security be threaten

 we be place our armed force in strategic military position

 we will not hesitate to use our armed force to repel attack

 we reassert our abide faith in the vitality of our constitutional republic as a perpetual home of freedom of tolerance and of devotion to the word of god

 therefore with profound consciousness of my responsibility to my countryman and to my country 's cause i have tonight issue a proclamation that an unlimited national emergency exist and require the strengthening of our defense to the extreme limit of our national power and authority

 the nation will expect all individual and all group to play their full part without stint and without selfishness and without doubt that our democracy will triumphantly survive

 i repeat the word of the signer of the declaration of independence that little band of patriot fight long ago against overwhelming odd but certain as we be now of ultimate victory with a firm reliance on the protection of divine providence we mutually pledge to each other our life our fortune and our sacred honor

my fellow americans
 the navy department of the united states have report to i that on the morning of september fourth the united states destroyer greer proceed in full daylight towards iceland have reach a point southeast of greenland she be carry american mail to iceland she be fly the american flag her identity as an american ship be unmistakable
 she be then and there attack by a submarine germany admit that it be a german submarine the submarine deliberately fire a torpedo at the greer follow later by another torpedo attack in spite of what hitler 's propaganda bureau have invent and in spite of what any american obstructionist organization may prefer to believe i tell you the blunt fact that the german submarine fire first upon this american destroyer without warning and with deliberate design to sink she
 our destroyer at the time be in water which the government of the united states have declare to be water of self defense surround outpost of american protection in the atlantic
 in the north of the atlantic outpost have be establish by we in iceland in greenland in labrador and in newfoundland through these water there pass many ship of many flag they bear food and other supply to civilian and they bear material of war for which the people of the united states be spend billion of dollar and which by congressional action they have declare to be essential for the defense of their our own land
 the united states destroyer when attack be proceed on a legitimate mission
 if the destroyer be visible to the submarine when the torpedo be fire then the attack be a deliberate attempt by the nazis to sink a clearly identify american warship on the other hand if the submarine be beneath the surface of the sea and with the aid of its listening device fire in the direction of the sound of the american destroyer without even take the trouble to learn its identity as the official german communique would indicate then the attack be even more outrageous for it indicate a policy of indiscriminate violence against any vessel sail the sea --belligerent or non belligerent
 this be piracy piracy legally and morally it be not the first nor the last act of piracy which the nazi government have commit against the american flag in this war for attack have follow attack
 a few month ago an american flag merchant ship the robin moor be sink by a nazi submarine in the middle of the south atlantic under circumstance violate long establish international law and violate every principle of humanity the passenger and the crew be force into open boat hundred of mile from land in direct violation of international agreement sign by nearly all nation include the government of germany no apology no allegation of mistake no offer of reparation have come from the nazi government
 in july 1941 nearly two month ago an american battleship in north american water be follow by a submarine which for a long time seek to maneuver itself into a position of attack upon the battleship the periscope of the submarine be clearly see no british or american submarine be within hundred of mile of this spot at the time so the nationality of the submarine be clear
 five day ago a united states navy ship on patrol pick up three survivor of an american own ship operate under the flag of our sister republic of panama the s. s. sessa on august seventeenth she have be first torpedo without warning and then shell near greenland while carry civilian supply to iceland it be fear that the other member of her crew have be drown in view of the establish presence of german submarine in this vicinity there can be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the flag of the attacker
 five day ago another united states merchant ship the steel seafarer be sink by a german aircraft in the red sea two hundred and twenty mile south of suez she be bind for an egyptian port
 so four of the vessel sink or attack fly the american flag and be clearly identifiable two of these ship be warship of the american navy in the fifth case the vessel sink clearly carry the flag of our sister republic of panama
 in the face of all this we americans be keep our foot on the ground our type of democratic civilization have outgrow the thought of feeling compel to fight some other nation by reason of any single piratical attack on one of our ship we be not become hysterical or lose our sense of proportion therefore what i be think and say tonight do not relate to any isolated episode
 instead we americans be take a long range point of view in regard to certain fundamental and a point of view in regard to a series of event on land and on sea which must be consider as a whole as a part of a world pattern
 it would be unworthy of a great nation to exaggerate an isolated incident or to become inflame by some one act of violence but it would be inexcusable folly to minimize such incident in the face of evidence which make it clear that the incident be not isolate but be part of a general plan
 the important truth be that these act of international lawlessness be a manifestation of a design which a design that have be make clear to the american people for a long time it be the nazi design to abolish the freedom of the sea and to acquire absolute control and domination of the these sea for themselves
 for with control of the sea in their own hand the way can obviously become clear for their next step domination of the united states and the domination of the western hemisphere by force of arm under nazi control of the sea no merchant ship of the united states or of any other american republic would be free to carry on any peaceful commerce except by the condescend grace of this foreign and tyrannical power the atlantic ocean which have be and which should always be a free and friendly highway for we would then become a deadly menace to the commerce of the united states to the coast of the united states and even to the inland city of the united states
 the hitler government in defiance of the law of the sea and in defiance of the recognize right of all other nation have presume to declare on paper that great area of the sea even include a vast expanse lie in the western hemisphere be to be close and that no ship may enter they for any purpose except at peril of be sink actually they be sink ship at will and without warn in widely separate area both within and far outside of these far fling pretended zone
 this nazi attempt to seize control of the ocean be but a counterpart of the nazi plot now be carry on throughout the western hemisphere all design toward the same end for hitler 's advance guard not only his avow agent but also his dupe among we have seek to make ready for he foothold and bridgehead in the new world to be use as soon as he have gain control of the ocean
 his intrigue his plot his machination his sabotage in this new world be all know to the government of the united states conspiracy have follow conspiracy for example last year a plot to seize the government of uruguay be smash by the prompt action of that country which be support in full by her american neighbor a like plot be then hatch in argentina and that government have carefully and wisely block it at every point more recently an endeavor be make to subvert the government of bolivia and within the past few week the discovery be make of secret air land field in colombia within easy range of the panama canal i could multiply instance(s upon instance
 to be ultimately successful in world mastery hitler know that he must get control of the sea he must first destroy the bridge of ship which we be build across the atlantic and over which we shall continue to roll the implement of war to help destroy he and)to destroy all his work in the end he must wipe out our patrol on sea and in the air if he be to do it he must silence the british navy
 i think it must be explain again and over and over again to people who like to think of the united states navy as an invincible protection that this can be true only if the british navy survive and that my friend be simple arithmetic
 for if the world outside of the americas fall under axis domination the shipbuilding facility which the axis power would then possess in all of europe in the british isles and in the far east would be much great than all the shipbuilding facility and potentiality of all of the americas not only great but two or three time great enough to win even if the united states throw all its resource into such a situation seek to double and even redouble the size of our navy the axis power in control of the rest of the world would have the manpower and the physical resource to outbuild we several time over
 it be time for all americans americans of all the americas to stop be delude by the romantic notion that the americas can go on live happily and peacefully in a nazi dominate world
 generation after generation america have battle for the general policy of the freedom of the sea and that policy be a very simple one but a basic a fundamental one it mean that no nation have the right to make the broad ocean of the world at great distance from the actual theatre of land war unsafe for the commerce of other
 that have be our policy prove time and time again in all of our history our policy have apply from time immemorial the early day of the republic and still apply not merely to the atlantic but to the pacific and to all other ocean as well
 unrestricted submarine warfare in 1941 constitute defiance an act of aggression against that historic american policy
 it be now clear that hitler have begin his campaign to control the sea by ruthless force and by wipe out every vestige of international law and every vestige of humanity
 his intention have be make clear the american people can have no further illusion about it
 no tender whispering of appeaser that hitler be not interested in the western hemisphere no soporific lullaby that a wide ocean protect we from he can long have any effect on the hard head far sighted and realistic american people
 because of these episode because of the movement and operation of german warship and because of the clear repeat proof that the present government of germany have no respect for treaty or for international law that it have no decent attitude toward neutral nation or human life we americans be now face to face not with abstract theory but with cruel relentless fact
 this attack on the greer be no localized military operation in the north atlantic this be no mere episode in a struggle between two nation this be one determined step towards create a permanent world system base on force on terror and on murder
 and i be sure that even now the nazis be wait wait to see whether the united states will by silence give they the green light to go ahead on this path of destruction
 the nazi danger to our western world have long cease to be a mere possibility the danger be here now not only from a military enemy but from an enemy of all law all liberty all morality all religion
 there have now come a time when you and i must see the cold inexorable necessity of say to these inhuman unrestrained seeker of world conquest and permanent world domination by the sword you seek to throw our child and our child 's child into your form of terrorism and slavery you have now attack our own safety you shall go no far
 normal practice of diplomacy note write be of no possible use in deal with international outlaw who sink our ship and kill our citizen
 one peaceful nation after another have meet disaster because each refuse to look the nazi danger squarely in the eye until it have actually have they by the throat
 the united states will not make that fatal mistake
 no act of violence or no act of intimidation will keep we from maintain intact two bulwark of american defense first our line of supply of material to the enemy of hitler and second the freedom of our shipping on the high sea
 no matter what it take no matter what it cost we will keep open the line of legitimate commerce in these defensive water of ours
 we have seek no shoot war with hitler we do not seek it now but neither do we want peace so much that we be willing to pay for it by permit he to attack our naval and merchant ship while they be on legitimate business
 i assume that the german leader be not deeply concern tonight or any other time by what we americans or the american government say or publish about they we can not bring about the downfall of nazi ism by the use of long range invective
 but when you see a rattlesnake poise to strike you do not wait until he have strike before you crush he
 these nazi submarine and raider be the rattlesnake of the atlantic they be a menace to the free pathway of the high sea they be a challenge to our own sovereignty they hammer at our most precious right when they attack ship of the american flag symbol of our independence our freedom our very life
 it be clear to all americans that the time have come when the americas themselves must now be defend a continuation of attack in our own water or in water which that could be use for further and great attack on we will inevitably weaken our american ability to repel hitlerism
 do not let we split hair be hair splitter let we not ask ourselves whether the americas should begin to defend themselves after the fifth first attack or the tenth fifth attack or the tenth attack or the twentieth attack
 the time for active defense be now
 do not let we split hair let we not say we will only defend ourselves if the torpedo succeed in get home or if the crew and the passenger be drown
 this be the time for prevention of attack
 if submarine or raider attack in distant water they can attack equally well within sight of our own shore their very presence in any water which america deem vital to its defense constitute an attack
 in the water which we deem necessary for our defense american naval vessel and american plane will no long wait until axis submarine lurk under the water or axis raider on the surface of the sea strike their deadly blow first
 upon our naval and air patrol now operate in large number over a vast expanse of the atlantic ocean fall the duty of maintain the american policy of freedom of the sea now that mean very simply and very clearly that our patrolling vessel and plane will protect all merchant ship not only american ship but ship of any flag engage in commerce in our defensive water they will protect they from submarine they will protect they from surface raider
 this situation be not new the second president of the united states john adams order the united states navy to clean out european privateer and european ship of war which be infest the caribbean and south american water destroy american commerce
 the third president of the united states thomas jefferson order the united states navy to end the attack be make upon american and other ship by the corsair of the nation of north africa
 my obligation as president be historic it be clear yes it be inescapable
 it be no act of war on our part when we decide to protect the sea which that be vital to american defense the aggression be not ours ours be solely defense
 but let this warning be clear from now on if german or italian vessel of war enter the water the protection of which be necessary for american defense they do so at their own peril
 the order which i have give as commander in chief to of the united states army and navy be to carry out that policy at once
 the sole responsibility rest upon germany there will be no shooting unless germany continue to seek it
 that be my obvious duty in this crisis that be the clear right of this sovereign nation that this be the only step possible if we would keep tight the wall of defense which we be pledge to maintain around this western hemisphere
 i have no illusion about the gravity of this step i have not take it hurriedly or lightly it be the result of month and month of constant thought and anxiety and prayer in the protection of your nation and mine it can not be avoid
 the american people have face other grave crisis in their history with american courage and with american resolution they will do no less today
 they know the actuality of the attack upon we they know the necessity of a bold defense against these attack they know that the time call for clear head and fearless heart
 and with that inner strength that come to a free people conscious of their duty and conscious of the righteousness of what they do they will with divine help and guidance stand their ground against this late assault upon their democracy their sovereignty and their freedom

mr. vice president and mr. speaker and member of the senate and house of representatives
 yesterday december 7 1941 a date which will live in infamy the united states of america be suddenly and deliberately attack by naval and air force of the empire of japan
 the united states be at peace with that nation and at the solicitation of japan be still in conversation with its government and its emperor look toward the maintenance of peace in the pacific indeed one hour after japanese air squadron have commence bombing in the american island of oahu the japanese ambassador to the united states and his colleague deliver to our secretary of state a formal reply to a recent american message and while this reply state that it seem useless to continue the exist diplomatic negotiation it contain no threat or hint of war or of armed attack
 it will be record that the distance of hawaii from japan make it obvious that the attack be deliberately plan many day or even week ago during the intervene time the japanese government have deliberately seek to deceive the united states by false statement and expression of hope for continued peace
 the attack yesterday on the hawaiian islands have cause severe damage to american naval and military force i regret to tell you that very many american life have be lose in addition american ship have be report torpedo on the high sea between san francisco and honolulu
 yesterday the japanese government also launch an attack against malaya
 last night japanese force attack hong kong
 last night japanese force attack guam
 last night japanese force attack the philippine islands
 last night the japanese attack wake island and this morning the japanese attack midway island
 japan have therefore undertake a surprise offensive extend throughout the pacific area the fact of yesterday and today speak for themselves the people of the united states have already form their opinion and well understand the implication to the very life and safety of our nation
 as commander in chief of the army and navy i have direct that all measure be take for our defense
 but always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against we
 no matter how long it may take we to overcome this premeditated invasion the american people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory i believe that i interpret the will of the congress and of the people when i assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger we
 hostility exist there be no blink at the fact that our people our territory and our interest be in grave danger
 with confidence in our armed force with the unbounde determination of our people we will gain the inevitable triumph so help we god
 i ask that the congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by japan on sunday december 7 1941 a state of war have exist between the united states and the japanese empire

my fellow americans
 the sudden criminal attack perpetrate by the japanese in the pacific provide the climax of a decade of international immorality
 powerful and resourceful gangster have band together to make war upon the whole human race their challenge have now be fling at the united states of america the japanese have treacherously violate the longstanding peace between we many american soldier and sailor have be kill by enemy action american ship have be sink american airplane have be destroy
 the congress and the people of the united states have accept that challenge
 together with other free people we be now fight to maintain our right to live among our world neighbor in freedom in common decency without fear of assault
 i have prepare the full record of our past relation with japan and it will be submit to the congress it begin with the visit of commodore parry to japan eighty eight year ago it end with the visit of two japanese emissary to the secretary of state last sunday an hour after japanese force have loose their bomb and machine gun against our flag our force and our citizen
 i can say with utmost confidence that no americans today or a thousand year hence need feel anything but pride in our patience and in our effort through all the year toward achieve a peace in the pacific which would be fair and honorable to every nation large or small and no honest person today or a thousand year hence will be able to suppress a sense of indignation and horror at the treachery commit by the military dictator of japan under the very shadow of the flag of peace bear by their special envoy in our midst
 the course that japan have follow for the past ten year in asia have parallel the course of hitler and mussolini in europe and in africa today it have become far more than a parallel it be actual collaboration so well calculate that all the continent of the world and all the ocean be now consider by the axis strategist as one gigantic battlefield
 in 1931 ten year ago japan invade manchukuo without warn
 in 1935 italy invade ethiopia without warn in 1938 hitler occupy austria without warn
 in 1939 hitler invade czechoslovakia without warn later in 39 hitler invade poland without warn in 1940 hitler invade norway denmark the netherlands belgium and luxembourg without warn
 in 1940 italy attack france and later greece without warn
 and this year in 1941 the axis powers attack yugoslavia and greece and they dominate the balkans without warn in 1941 also hitler invade russia without warn and now japan have attack malaya and thailand and the united states without warn
 it be all of one pattern
 we be now in this war we be all in it all the way every single man woman and child be a partner in the most tremendous undertaking of our american history we must share together the bad news and the good news the defeat and the victory the change fortune of war
 so far the news have be all bad we have suffer a serious setback in hawaii our force in the philippines which include the brave people of that commonwealth be take punishment but be defend themselves vigorously the report from guam and wake and midway islands be still confused but we must be prepare for the announcement that all these three outpost have be seize
 the casualty list of these first few day will undoubtedly be large i deeply feel the anxiety of all of the family of the man in our armed force and the relative of people in city which have be bomb i can only give they my solemn promise that they will get news just as quickly as possible
 this government will put its trust in the stamina of the american people and will give the fact to the public just as soon as two condition have be fulfil first that the information have be definitely and officially confirm and second that the release of the information at the time it be receive will not prove valuable to the enemy directly or indirectly
 most earnestly i urge my countryman to reject all rumor these ugly little hint of complete disaster fly thick and fast in wartime they have to be examine and appraise
 as an example i can tell you frankly that until further survey be make i have not sufficient information to state the exact damage which have be do to our naval vessel at pearl harbor admittedly the damage be serious but no one can say how serious until we know how much of this damage can be repair and how quickly the necessary repair can be make
 i cite as another example a statement make on sunday night that a japanese carrier have be locate and sink off the canal zone and when you hear statement that be attribute to what they call an authoritative source you can be reasonably sure from now on that under these war circumstance the authoritative source be not any person in authority
 many rumor and report which we now hear originate of course with enemy source for instance today the japanese be claim that as a result of their one action against hawaii they hare gain naval supremacy in the pacific this be an old trick of propaganda which have be use innumerable time by the nazis the purpose of such fantastic claim be of course to spread fear and confusion among we and to goad we into reveal military information which our enemy be desperately anxious to obtain
 our government will not be catch in this obvious trap and neither will the people of the united states
 it must be remember by each and every one of we that our free and rapid communication these day must be greatly restrict in wartime it be not possible to receive full and speedy and accurate report front distant area of combat this be particularly true where naval operation be concern for in these day of the marvel of the radio it be often impossible for the commanders of various unit to report their activity by radio at all for the very simple reason that this information would become available to the enemy and would disclose their position and their plan of defense or attack
 of necessity there will be delay in officially confirm or deny report of operation but we will not hide fact from the country if we know the fact and if the enemy will not be aid by their disclosure
 to all newspaper and radio station all those who reach the eye and ear of the american people i say this you have a most grave responsibility to the nation now and for the duration of this war
 if you feel that your government be not disclose enough of the truth you have every right to say so but in the absence of all the fact as reveal by official source you have no right in the ethic of patriotism to deal out unconfirmed report in such a way as to make people believe that they be gospel truth
 every citizen in every walk of life share this same responsibility the life of our soldier and sailor the whole future of this nation depend upon the manner in which each and every one of we fulfill his obligation to our country
 now a word about the recent past and the future a year and a half have elapse since the fall of france when the whole world first realize the mechanized might which the axis nation have be build up for so many year america have use that year and a half to great advantage know that the attack might reach we in all too short a time we immediately begin greatly to increase our industrial strength and our capacity to meet the demand of modern warfare
 precious month be gain by send vast quantity of our war material to the nation of the world still able to resist axis aggression our policy rest on the fundamental truth that the defense of any country resist hitler or japan be in the long run the defense of our own country that policy have be justify it have give we time invaluable time to build our american assembly line of production
 assembly line be now in operation other be be rush to completion a steady stream of tank and plane of gun and ship and shell and equipment that be what these eighteen month have give we
 but it be all only a beginning of what still have to be do we must be set to face a long war against crafty and powerful bandit the attack at pearl harbor can be repeat at any one of many point point in both ocean and along both our coast line and against all the rest of the hemisphere
 it will not only be a long war it will be a hard war that be the basis on which we now lie all our plan that be the yardstick by which we measure what we shall need and demand money material double and quadruple production ever increase the production must be not only for our own army and navy and air force it must reinforce the other army and navy and air force fight the nazis and the war lord of japan throughout the americas and throughout the world
 i have be work today on the subject of production your government have decide on two broad policy
 the first be to speed up all exist production by work on a seven day week basis in every war industry include the production of essential raw material
 the second policy now be put into form be to rush addition to the capacity of production by build more new plant by add to old plant and by use the many small plant for war need
 over the hard road of the past month we have at time meet obstacle and difficulty division and dispute indifference and callousness that be now all past and i be sure forget
 the fact be that the country now have an organization in washington build around man and woman who be recognize expert in their own field i think the country know that the people who be actually responsible in each and every one of these many field be pull together with a teamwork that have never before be excel
 on the road ahead there lie hard work gruele work day and night every hour and every minute
 i be about to add that ahead there lie sacrifice for all of we
 but it be not correct to use that word the united states do not consider it a sacrifice to do all one can to give one 's good to our nation when the nation be fight for its existence and its future life
 it be not a sacrifice for any man old or young to be in the army or the navy of the united states rather it be a privilege
 it be not a sacrifice for the industrialist or the wage earner the farmer or the shopkeeper the trainman or the doctor to pay more taxis to buy more bond to forego extra profit to work long or hard at the task for which he be well fit rather it be a privilege
 it be not a sacrifice to do without many thing to which we be accustomed if the national defense call for do without it
 a review this morning lead i to the conclusion that at present we shall not have to curtail the normal use of article of food there be enough food today for all of we and enough leave over to send to those who be fight on the same side with we
 but there will be a clear and definite shortage of metal for many kind of civilian use for the very good reason that in our increase program we shall need for war purpose more than half of that portion of the principal metal which during the past year have go into article for civilian use yes we shall have to give up many thing entirely
 and i be sure that the people in every part of the nation be prepare in their individual live to win this war i be sure that they will cheerfully help to pay a large part of its financial cost while it go on i be sure they will cheerfully give up those material thing that they be ask to give up
 and i be sure that they will retain all those great spiritual thing without which we can not win through
 i repeat that the united states can accept no result save victory final and complete not only must the shame of japanese treachery be wipe out but the source of international brutality wherever they exist must be absolutely and finally break
 in my message to the congress yesterday i say that we will make very certain that this form of treachery shall never endanger we again in order to achieve that certainty we must begin the great task that be before we by abandon once and for all the illusion that we can ever again isolate ourselves from the rest of humanity
 in these past few year and most violently in the past three day we have learn a terrible lesson

 it be our obligation to our dead it be our sacred obligation to their child and to our child that we must never forget what we have learn
 and what we have learn be this
 there be no such thing as security for any nation or any individual in a world rule by the principle of gangsterism
 there be no such thing as impregnable defense against powerful aggressor who sneak up in the dark and strike without warn
 we have learn that our ocean girt hemisphere be not immune from severe attack that we can not measure our safety in term of mile on any map any more
 we may acknowledge that our enemy have perform a brilliant feat of deception perfectly time and execute with great skill it be a thoroughly dishonorable deed but we must face the fact that modern warfare as conduct in the nazi manner be a dirty business we do not like it we do not want to get in it but we be in it and we be go to fight it with everything we have get
 i do not think any american have any doubt of our ability to administer proper punishment to the perpetrator of these crime
 your government know that for week germany have be tell japan that if japan do not attack the united states japan would not share in divide the spoil with germany when peace come she be promise by germany that if she come in she would receive the complete and perpetual control of the whole of the pacific area and that mean not only the ear east but also all of the islands in the pacific and also a stranglehold on the west coast of north central and south america
 we know also that germany and japan be conduct their military and naval operation in accordance with a joint plan that plan consider all people and nation which be not help the axis power as common enemy of each and every one of the axis power
 that be their simple and obvious grand strategy and that be why the american people must realize that it can be match only with similar grand strategy we must realize for example that japanese success against the united states in the pacific be helpful to german operation in libya that any german success against the caucasus be inevitably an assistance to japan in her operation against the dutch east indies that a german attack against algiers or morocco open the way to a german attack against south america and the canal
 on the other side of the picture we must learn also to know that guerilla warfare against the germans in let we say serbia or norway help we that a successful russian offensive against the germans help we and that british success on land or sea in any part of the world strengthen our hand
 remember always that germany and italy regardless of any formal declaration of war consider themselves at war with the united states at this moment just as much as they consider themselves at war with britain or russia and germany put all the other republics of the americas into the same category of enemy the people of our sister republics of this hemisphere can be honor by that fact
 the true goal we seek be far above and beyond the ugly field of battle when we resort to force as now we must we be determined that this force shall be direct toward ultimate good as well as against immediate evil we americans be not destroyer we be builder
 we be now in the midst of a war not for conquest not for vengeance but for a world in which this nation and all that this nation represent will be safe for our child we expect to eliminate the danger from japan but it would serve we ill if we accomplish that and find that the rest of the world be dominate by hitler and mussolini
 so we be go to win the war and we be go to win the peace that follow
 and in the difficult hour of this day through dark day that may be yet to come we will know that the vast majority of the member of the human race be on our side many of they be fight with we all of they be pray for we but in represent our cause we represent theirs as well our hope and their hope for liberty under god



to the congress

 on the morning of december eleventh the government of germany pursue its course of world conquest declare war against the united states

 the long know and the long expect have thus take place the force endeavor to enslave the entire world now be move toward this hemisphere

 never before have there be a great challenge to life liberty and civilization

 delay invite great danger rapid and united effort by all of the people of the world who be determined to remain free will insure a world victory of the force of justice and of righteousness over the force of savagery and of barbarism

 italy also have declare war against the united states

 i therefore request the congress to recognize a state of war between the united states and germany and between the united states and italy
my fellow americans

 washington 's birthday be a most appropriate occasion for we to talk with each other about thing as they be today and thing as we know they shall be in the future

 for eight year general washington and his continental army be face continually with formidable odd and recur defeat supply and equipment be lack in a sense every winter be a valley forge throughout the 13 state there exist fifth columnist and selfish man jealous man fearful man who proclaim that washington 's cause be hopeless and that he should ask for a negotiate peace

 washington 's conduct in those hard time have provide the model for all americans ever since a model of moral stamina he hold to his course as it have be chart in the declaration of independence he and the brave man who serve with he know that no man 's life or fortune be secure without freedom and free institution

 the present great struggle have teach we increasingly that freedom of person and security of property anywhere in the world depend upon the security of the right and obligation of liberty and justice everywhere in the world

 this war be a new kind of war it be different from all other war of the past not only in its method and weapon but also in its geography it be warfare in term of every continent every island every sea every air lane in the world

 that be the reason why i have ask you to take out and spread before you the a map of the whole earth and to follow with i in the reference which i shall make to the world encircle battle line of this war many question will i fear remain unanswered tonight but i know you will realize that i can not cover everything in any one short report to the people

 the broad ocean which have be herald in the past as our protection from attack have become endless battlefield on which we be constantly be challenge by our enemy

 we must all understand and face the hard fact that our job now be to fight at distance which extend all the way around the globe

 we fight at these vast distance because that be where our enemy be until our flow of supply give we clear superiority we must keep on strike our enemy wherever and whenever we can meet they even if for a while we have to yield ground actually though we be take a heavy toll of the enemy every day that go by

 we must fight at these vast distance to protect our supply line and our line of communication with our ally protect these line from the enemy who be bend every ounce of their strength strive against time to cut they the object of the nazis and the japanese be to of course separate the united states britain china and russia and to isolate they one from another so that each will be surround and cut off from source of supply and reinforcement it be the old familiar axis policy of divide and conquer

 there be those who still think however in term of the day of sailing ship they advise we to pull our warship and our plane and our merchant ship into our own home water and concentrate solely on last ditch defense but let i illustrate what would happen if we follow such foolish advice

 look at your map look at the vast area of china with its million of fight man look at the vast area of russia with its powerful army and prove military might look at the british isles islands of britain australia new zealand the dutch indies india the near east and the continent of africa with their re)source of raw material their resource of raw material and of people determine to resist axis domination look too at north america central america and south america

 it be obvious what would happen if all of these great reservoir of power be cut off from each other either by enemy action or by self impose isolation

 1 first in such a case we could no long send aid of any kind to china to the brave people who for nearly five year have withstand japanese assault destroy hundred of thousand of japanese soldier and vast quantity of japanese war munition it be essential that we help china in her magnificent defense and in her inevitable counteroffensive for that be one important element in the ultimate defeat of japan

 2 secondly if we lose communication with the southwest pacific all of that area include australia and new zealand and the dutch indies would fall under japanese domination japan in such a case could then release great number of ship and man to launch attack on a large scale against the coast of the western hemisphere south america and central america and north america include alaska at the same time she could immediately extend her conquest to in the other direction toward india and through the indian ocean to africa and to the near east and try to join force with germany and italy

 3 third if we be to stop send munition to the british and the russians in the mediterranean area and in the persian gulf and the red sea area we would be help the nazis to overrun turkey and syria and iraq and persia that be now call iran egypt and the suez canal the whole coast of north africa itself and with that inevitably the whole coast of west africa put germany within easy striking distance of south america 1,500 mile away

 4 fourth if by such a fatuous policy we cease to protect the north atlantic supply line to britain and to russia we would help to cripple the splendid counter offensive by russia against the nazis and we would help to deprive britain of essential food supply and munition

 those americans who believe that we could live under the illusion of isolationism want the american eagle to imitate the tactic of the ostrich now many of those same people afraid that we may be stick our neck out want our national bird to be turn into a turtle but we prefer to retain the eagle as it be fly high and strike hard

 i know that i speak for the mass of the american people when i say that we reject the turtle policy and will continue increasingly the policy of carry the war to the enemy in distant land and distant water as far away as possible from our own home ground

 there be four main line of communication now be travel by our ship the north atlantic the south atlantic the indian ocean and the south pacific these route be not one way street for the ship which that carry our troop and munition out bind bring back essential raw material which we require for our own use

 the maintenance of these vital line be a very tough job it be a job which require tremendous daring tremendous resourcefulness and above all tremendous production of plane and tank and gun and also of the ship to carry they and i speak again for the american people when i say that we can and will do that job

 the defense of the world wide line of communication demand compel relatively safe use by we of the sea and of the air along the various route and this in turn depend upon control by the united nations of the many strategic basis along those route

 control of the air involve the simultaneous use of two type of plane first the long range heavy bomber and second the light bomber the dive bomber the torpedo plane and the short range pursuit plane all of which be essential to the cooperate with and protect(ion of the basis and of the bomber themselves

 heavy bomber can fly under their own power from here to the southwest pacific either way but the small plane can not therefore these light plane have to be pack in crate and send on board cargo ship look at your map again and you will see that the route be long and at many place perilous either across the south atlantic all the way a)round south africa and the cape of good hope or from california to the east indies direct a vessel can make a round trip by either route in about four month or only three round trip in a whole year

 in spite of the length and in spite of the difficulty of this transportation i can tell you that in two and a half month we already have a large number of bomber and pursuit plane man by american pilot and crew which be now in daily contact with the enemy in the southwest pacific and thousand of american troop be today in that area engage in operation not only in the air but on the ground as well

 in this battle area japan have have an obvious initial advantage for she could fly even her short range plane to the point of attack by use many stepping stone open to her basis in a multitude of pacific island and also base on the china coast indo china coast and in thailand and malaya coast japanese troop transport could go south from japan and from china through the narrow china sea which can be protect by japanese plane throughout its whole length

 i ask you to look at your map again particularly at that portion of the pacific ocean lie west of hawaii before this war even start the philippine islands be already surround on three side by japanese power on the west the china side the japanese be in possession of the coast of china and the coast of indo china which have be yield to they by the vichy french on the north be the island of japan themselves reach down almost to northern luzon on the east be the mandated islands which japan have occupy exclusively and have fortify in absolute violation of her write word

 the island that lie between hawaii and the philippines these island hundred of they appear only as small dot on most map but do not appear at all but they cover a large strategic area guam lie in the middle of they a lone outpost which we have never fortify

 under the washington treaty of 1921 we have solemnly agree not to add to the fortification of the philippines islands we have no safe naval basis there so we could not use the island for extensive naval operation

 immediately after this war start the japanese force move down on either side of the philippines to numerous point south of they thereby completely encircle the islands philippines from north and south and east and west

 it be that complete encirclement with control of the air by japanese land base aircraft which have prevent we from send substantial reinforcement of man and material to the gallant defender of the philippines for forty year it have always be our strategy a strategy bear of necessity that in the event of a full scale attack on the islands by japan we should fight a delaying action attempt to retire slowly into bataan peninsula and corregidor

 we know that the war as a whole would have to be fight and win by a process of attrition against japan itself we know all along that with our great resource we could ultimately out build japan and ultimately overwhelm she on sea and on land and in the air we know that to obtain our objective many variety of operation would be necessary in area other than the philippines

 now nothing that have occur in the past two month have cause we to revise this basic strategy of necessity except that the defense put up by general macarthur have magnificently exceed the previous estimate of endurance and he and his man be gain eternal glory therefore

 macarthur 's army of filipinos and americans and the force of the united nations in china in burma and the netherlands east indies be all together fulfil the same essential task they be make japan pay an increasingly terrible price for her ambitious attempt to seize control of the whole atlantic asiatic world every japanese transport sink off java be one less transport that they can use to carry reinforcement to their army oppose general macarthur in luzon

 it have be say that japanese gain in the philippines be make possible only by the success of their surprise attack on pearl harbor i tell you that this be not so

 even if the attack have not be make your map will show that it would have be a hopeless operation for we to send the fleet to the philippines through thousand of mile of ocean while all those island basis be under the sole control of the japanese

 the consequence of the attack on pearl harbor serious as they be have be wildly exaggerated in other way and these exaggeration come originally from axis propagandist but they have be repeat i regret to say by americans in and out of public life

 you and i have the utmost contempt for americans who since pearl harbor have whisper or announce off the record that there be no long any pacific fleet that the fleet be all sink or destroy on december 7th that more than a thousand of our plane be destroy on the ground they have suggest slyly that the government have withhold the truth about casualty that 11,000 or 12,000 man be kill at pearl harbor instead of the figure as officially announce they have even serve the enemy propagandist by spread the incredible story that shipload of body of our honored american dead be about to arrive in new york harbor to be put into a common grave

 almost every axis broadcast berlin rome tokyo directly quote americans who by speech or in the press make damnable misstatement such as these

 the american people realize that in many case detail of military operation can not be disclose until we be absolutely certain that the announcement will not give to the enemy military information which he do not already possess

 your government have unmistakable confidence in your ability to hear the bad without flinch or lose heart you must in turn have complete confidence that your government be keep nothing from you except information that will help the enemy in his attempt to destroy we in a democracy there be always a solemn pact of truth between government and the people but there must also always be a full use of discretion and that word discretion apply to the critic of government as well

 this be war the american people want to know and will be tell the general trend of how the war be go but they do not wish to help the enemy any more than our fighting force do and they will pay little attention to the rumor monger and the poison peddler in our midst

 to pass from the realm of rumor and poison to the field of fact the number of our officer and man kill in the attack on pearl harbor on december 7th be 2,340 and the number wound be 940 of all of the combatant ship base on pearl harbor battleship heavy cruiser light cruiser aircraft carrier destroyer and submarine only three be be permanently put out of commission

 very many of the ship of the pacific fleet be not even in pearl harbor some of those that be there be hit very slightly and other that be damage have either rejoin the fleet by now or be still undergo repair and when those repair be complete the ship will be more efficient fighting machine than they be before

 the report that we lose more than a thousand air)planes at pearl harbor be as baseless as the other weird rumor the japanese do not know just how many plane they destroy that day and i be not go to tell they but i can say that to date and include pearl harbor we have destroy considerably more japanese plane than they have destroy of our

 we have most certainly suffer loss from hitler 's u boats in the atlantic as well as from the japanese in the pacific and we shall suffer more of they before the turn of the tide but speak for the united states of america let i say once and for all to the people of the world we americans have be compel to yield ground but we will regain it we and the other united nations be commit to the destruction of the militarism of japan and germany we be daily increase our strength soon we and not our enemy will have the offensive we not they will win the final battle and we not they will make the final peace

 conquered nation in europe know what the yoke of the nazis be like and the people of korea and of manchuria know in their flesh the harsh despotism of japan all of the people of asia know that if there be to be an honorable and decent future for any of they or any of for us that future depend on victory by the united nations over the force of axis enslavement

 if a just and durable peace be to be attain or even if all of we be merely to save our own skin there be one thought for we here at home to keep uppermost the fulfillment of our special task of production uninterrupted production i stress that word uninterrupted

 germany italy and japan be very close to their maximum output of plane gun tank and ship the united nations be not especially the united states of america

 our first job then be to build up production uninterrupted production so that the united nations can maintain control of the sea and attain control of the air not merely a slight superiority but an overwhelming superiority

 on january 6th of this year i set certain definite goal of production for airplane tank gun and ship the axis propagandist call they fantastic tonight nearly two month later and after a careful survey of progress by donald nelson and other charge with responsibility for our production i can tell you that those goal will be attain

 in every part of the country expert in production and the man and woman at work in the plant be give loyal service with few exception labor capital and farming realize that this be no time either to make undue profit or to gain special advantage one over the other

 we be call for new plant and addition addition to old plant we be call for plant conversion to war need we be seek more man and more woman to run they we be work long hour we be come to realize that one extra plane or extra tank or extra gun or extra ship complete tomorrow may in a few month turn the tide on some distant battlefield it may make the difference between life and death for some of our own fighting man we know now that if we lose this war it will be generation or even century before our conception of democracy can live again and we can lose this war only if use slow up our effort or if we waste our ammunition snipe at each other

 here be three high purpose for every american

 1 we shall not stop work for a single day if any dispute arise we shall keep on work while the dispute be solve by mediation or conciliation or arbitration until the war be win

 2 we shall not demand special gain or special privilege or special advantage for any one group or occupation

 3 we shall give up convenience and modify the routine of our life if our country ask we to do so we will do it cheerfully remember that the common enemy seek to destroy every home and every freedom in every part of our land

 this generation of americans have come to realize with a present and personal realization that there be something large and more important than the life of any individual or of any individual group something for which a man will sacrifice and gladly sacrifice not only his pleasure not only his good not only his association with those he love but his life itself in time of crisis when the future be in the balance we come to understand with full recognition and devotion what this nation be and what we owe to it

 the axis propagandist have try in various evil way to destroy our determination and our morale fail in that they be now try to destroy our confidence in our own ally they say that the british be finish that the russians and the chinese be about to quit patriotic and sensible americans will reject these absurdity and instead of listen to any of this crude propaganda they will recall some of the thing that nazis and japanese have say and be still say about we

 ever since this nation become the arsenal of democracy ever since enactment of lend lease there have be one persistent theme through all axis propaganda

 this theme have be that americans be admittedly rich and that americans have considerable industrial power but that americans be soft and decadent that they can not and will not unite and work and fight

 from berlin rome and tokyo we have be describe as a nation of weakling playboy who would hire british soldier or russian soldier or chinese soldier to do our fighting for we

 let they repeat that now
 let they tell that to general macarthur and his man
 let they tell that to the sailor who today be hit hard in the far water of the pacific
 let they tell that to the boy in the flying fortresses
 let they tell that to the marines

 the united nations constitute an association of independent people of equal dignity and equal importance the united nations be dedicate to a common cause we share equally and with equal zeal the anguish and the awful sacrifice of war in the partnership of our common enterprise we must share in a unified plan in which all of we must play our several part each of we be equally indispensable and dependent one on the other

 we have unify command and cooperation and comradeship

 we americans will contribute unified production and unified acceptance of sacrifice and of effort that mean a national unity that can know no limitation of race or creed or selfish politic the american people expect that much from themselves and the american people will find way and mean of express their determination to their enemy include the japanese admiral who have say that he will dictate the term of peace here in the white mouse

 we of the united nations be agree on certain broad principle in the kind of peace we seek the atlantic charter apply not only to the part of the world that border the atlantic but to the whole world disarmament of aggressor self determination of nation and people and the four freedom freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want and freedom from fear

 the british and the russian people have know the full fury of nazi onslaught there have be time when the fate of london and moscow be in serious doubt but there be never the slight question that either the british or the russians would yield and today all the united nations salute the superb russian army as it celebrate the 24th anniversary of its first assembly

 though their homeland be overrun the dutch people be still fight stubbornly and powerfully overseas

 the great chinese people have suffer grievous loss chungking have be almost wipe out of existence yet it remain the capital of an unbeatable china

 that be the conquering spirit which prevail throughout the united nations in this war

 the task that we americans now face will test we to the uttermost never before have we be call upon for such a prodigious effort never before have we have so little time in which to do so much

 these be the time that try man 's soul

 tom paine write those word on a drumhead by the light of a campfire that be when washington 's little army of ragged rugged man be retreat across new jersey having taste nothing naught but defeat

 and general washington order that these great word write by tom paine be read to the man of every regiment in the continental army and this be the assurance give to the first american armed force

 the summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of their country but he that stand it now deserve the love and thank of man and woman tyranny like hell be not easily conquer yet we have this consolation with we that the hard the sacrifice the more glorious the triumph

 so speak americans in the year 1776

 so speak americans today

my fellow americans
 it be nearly five month since we be attack at pearl harbor for the two year prior to that attack this country have be gear itself up to a high level of production of munition and yet our war effort have do little to dislocate the normal life of most of we
 since then we have dispatch strong force of our army and navy several hundred thousand of they to basis and battlefront thousand of mile from home we have step up our war production on a scale that be test our industrial power and our engineering genius and our economic structure to the utmost we have have no illusion about the fact that this would be be a tough job and a long one
 american warship be now in combat in the north and south atlantic in the arctic in the mediterranean in the indian ocean and in the north and south pacific american troop have take station in south america greenland iceland the british isles the near east the middle east and the far east the continent of australia and many island of the pacific american war plane man by americans be fly in actual combat over all the continent and all the ocean
 on the european front the most important development of the past year have be without question the crush counter offensive on the part of the great army of russia against the powerful german army these russian force have destroy and be destroy more armed power of our enemy troop plane tank and gun than all the other united nations put together
 in the mediterranean area matter remain on the surface much as they be but the situation there be receive very careful attention
 recently we have receive news of a change in government in what we use to know as the republic of france -a name dear to the heart of all lover of liberty a name and an institution which we hope will soon be restore to full dignity
 throughout the nazi occupation of france we have hope for the maintenance of a french government which would strive to regain independence to reestablish the principle of liberty equality and fraternity and to restore the historic culture of france our policy have be consistent from the very beginning however we be now greatly concerned lest those who have recently come to power may seek to force the brave french people into submission to nazi despotism
 the united nations will take measure if necessary to prevent the use of french territory in any part of the world for military purpose by the axis power the good people of france will readily understand that such action be essential for the united nations to prevent assistance to the army or navy or air force of germany or italy and or japan the overwhelming majority of the french people understand that the fight of the united nations be fundamentally their fight that our victory mean the restoration of a free and independent france and the saving of france from the slavery which would be impose upon she by her external enemy and by her internal traitor
 we know how the french people really feel we know that a deep seat determination to obstruct every step in the axis plan extend from occupied france through vichy france all the way to the people of their colony in every ocean and on every continent
 our plane be help in the defense of french colony today and soon american flying fortresses will be fight for the liberation of the darken continent of europe itself
 in all the occupy country there be man and woman and even little child who have never stop fight never stop resist never stop prove to the nazis that their so call new order can will never be enforce upon free people
 in the german and italian people themselves there be a grow conviction that the cause of nazi ism and fascism be hopeless that their political and military leader have lead they along the bitter road which lead not to world conquest but to final defeat they can not fail to contrast the present frantic speech of these leader with their arrogant boasting of a year ago and two year ago
 and on the other side of the world in the far east we have pass through a phase of serious loss
 we have inevitably lose control of a large portion of the philippine islands but this whole nation pay tribute to the filipino and american officer and man who hold out so long on bataan peninsula to those grim and gallant fighter who still hold corregidor where the flag fly and to the force which that be still strike effectively at the enemy on mindanao and other island
 the malayan peninsula and singapore be in the hand of the enemy the netherlands east indies be almost entirely occupy though resistance there continue many other island be in the possession of the japanese but there be good reason to believe that their southward advance have be check australia new zealand and much other territory will be basis for offensive action and we be determined that the territory which that have be lose will be regain
 the japanese be press their northward advance in against burma with considerable power drive toward india and china they have be oppose with great bravery by small british and chinese force aid by american flier
 the news in burma tonight be not good the japanese may cut the burma road but i want to say to the gallant people of china that no matter what advance the japanese may make way will be find to deliver airplane and munition of war to the army of generalissimo chiang kai shek
 we remember that the chinese people be the first to stand up and fight against the aggressor in this war and in the future an a still unconquerable china will play its proper role in maintain peace and prosperity not only in eastern asia but in the whole world
 for every advance that the japanese have make since they start their frenzied career of conquest they have have to pay a very heavy toll in warship in transport in plane and in man they be feel the effect of those loss
 it be even report from japan that somebody have drop bomb on tokyo and on other principal center of japanese war industry if this be true it be the first time in history that japan have suffer such indignity
 although the treacherous attack on pearl harbor be the immediate cause of our entry into the war that event find the american people spiritually prepared for war on a world wide scale we go into this war fighting we know what we be fight for we realize that the war have become what hitler originally proclaim it to be a total war
 not all of we can have the privilege of fight our enemy in distant part of the world
 not all of we can have the privilege of work in a munition factory or a shipyard or on the farm or in oil field or mine produce the weapon or the raw material which that be need by our armed force
 but there be one front and one battle where everyone in the united states every man woman and child be in action and will be privileged to remain in action throughout this war that front be right here at home in our daily life and in our daily task here at home everyone will have the privilege of make whatever self denial be necessary not only to supply our fight man but to keep the economic structure of our country fortify and secure during the war and after the war
 this will require of course the abandonment not only of luxury but of many other creature comfort
 every loyal american be aware of his individual responsibility whenever i hear anyone say the american people be complacent they need to be arouse i feel like ask he to come to washington and to read the mail that flood into the white house and into all department of this government the one question that recur through all these thousand of letter and message be what more can i do to help my country in win this war
 to build the factory and to buy the material and to pay the labor and to provide the transportation and to equip and feed and house the soldier sailor and marine and to do all the thousand of thing necessary in a war all cost a lot of money more money than have ever be spend by any nation at any time in the long history of the world
 we be now spend solely for war purpose the sum of about one hundred million dollar every day in the week but before this year be over that almost unbelievable rate of expenditure will be double
 all of this money have to be spend and spend quickly if we be to produce within the time now available the enormous quantity of weapon of war which we need but the spending of these tremendous sum present grave danger of disaster to our national economy
 when your government continue to spend these unprecedented sum for munition month by month and year by year that money go into the pocketbook and bank account of the people of the united states at the same time raw material and many manufactured good be necessarily take away from civilian use and machinery and factory be be convert to war production
 you do not have to be a professor of mathematic or economic to see that if people with plenty of cash start bid against each other for scarce good the price of those good they go up
 yesterday i submit to the congress of the united states a seven point program a program of general principle which take together could be call the national economic policy for attain the great objective of keep the cost of live down i repeat they now to you in substance
 first we must through heavy taxis keep personal and corporate profit at a low reasonable rate
 second we must fix ceiling on price and rent
 third we must stabilize wage
 fourth we must stabilize farm price
 fifth we must put more billion into war bonds
 sixth we must ration all essential commodity which be scarce
 seventh we must discourage installment buying and encourage pay off debt and mortgage
 i do not think it be necessary to repeat what i say yesterday to the congress in discuss these general principle the important thing to remember be that earn one of these point be dependent on the other if the whole program be to work
 some people be already take the position that every one of the seven point be correct except the one point which step on their own individual toe a few seem very willing to approve self denial on the part of their neighbor the only effective course of action be a simultaneous attack on all of the factor which increase the cost of living in one comprehensive all embrace program cover price and profit and wage and taxis and debt
 the blunt fact be that every single person in the united states be go to be affect by this program some of you will be affect more directly by one or two of these restrictive measure but all of you will be affect indirectly by all of they
 be you a business man or do you own stock in a business corporation well your profit be go to be cut down to a reasonably low level by taxation your income will be subject to high taxis indeed in these day when every available dollar should go to the war effort i do not think that any american citizen should have a net income in excess of $ 25,000 per year after payment of taxis
 be you a retailer or a wholesaler or a manufacturer or a farmer or a landlord ceiling be be place on the price at which you can sell your good or rent your property
 do you work for wage you will have to forego high wage for your particular job for the duration of the war
 all of we be use to spend money for thing that we want thing however which be not absolutely essential we will all have to forego that kind of spending because we must put every dime and every dollar we can possibly spare out of our earning into war bonds and stamps because the demand of the war effort require the rationing of good of which there be not enough to go around because the stopping of purchase of non essential will release thousand of worker who be need in the war effort
 as i tell the congress yesterday sacrifice be not exactly the proper word with which to describe this program of self denial when at the end of this great struggle we shall have save our free way of life we shall have make no sacrifice
 the price for civilization must be pay in hard work and sorrow and blood the price be not too high if you doubt it ask those million who live today under the tyranny of hitlerism
 ask the worker of france and norway and the netherlands whip to labor by the lash whether the stabilization of wage be too great a sacrifice
 ask the farmer of poland and denmark of czechoslovakia and france loot of their livestock starve while their own crop be steal from their land ask they whether parity price be too great a sacrifice
 ask the businessman of europe whose enterprise have be steal from their owner whether the limitation of profit and personal income be too great a sacrifice
 ask the woman and child whom hitler be starve whether the rationing of tire and gasoline and sugar be too great a sacrifice
 we do not have to ask they they have already give we their agonized answer
 this great war effort must be carry through to its victorious conclusion by the indomitable will and determination of the people as one great whole
 it must not be impede by the faint of heart
 it must not be impede by those who put their own selfish interest above the interest of the nation
 it must not be impede by those who pervert honest criticism into falsification of fact
 it must not be impede by self style expert either in economic or military problem who know neither true figure nor geography itself
 it must not be impede by a few bogus patriot who use the sacred freedom of the press to echo the sentiment of the propagandist in tokyo and berlin
 and above all it shall not be imperil by the handful of noisy traitor --betrayers of america and betrayer of christianity itself would be dictator who in their heart and soul have yield to hitlerism and would have this republic do likewise
 i shall use all of the executive power that i have to carry out the policy lay down if it become necessary to ask for any additional legislation in order to attain our objective of prevent a spiral in the cost of living i shall do so
 i know the american farmer the american workman and the american businessman i know that they will gladly embrace this economy and equality of sacrifice satisfied that it be necessary for the most vital and compelling motive in all their life win through to victory
 never in the memory of man have there be a war in which the courage the endurance and the loyalt(y)ie of civilian play so vital a part
 many thousand of civilian all over the world have be and be be kill or maim by enemy action indeed it be the fortitude of the common people of britain under fire which enable that island to stand and prevent hitler from win the war in 1940 the ruin of london and coventry and other city be today the proud monument to british heroism
 our own american civilian population be now relatively safe from such disaster and to an ever increase extent our soldier sailor and marine be fight with great bravery and great skill on far distant front to make sure that we shall remain safe
 i should like to tell you one or two story about the man we have in our armed force
 there be for instance example dr. corydon m. wassell he be a missionary well know for his good work in china he be a simple modest retire man nearly sixty year old but he enter the service of his country and be commission a lieutenant commander in the navy
 dr. wassell be assign to duty in java care for wounded officer and man of the cruiser houston and marblehead which have be in heavy action in the java sea
 when the japanese advance across the island it be decide to evacuate as many as possible of the wound to australia but about twelve of the man be so badly wound that they could not not be move dr. wassell remain with they these man know that he would be capture by the enemy but he decide to make a last desperate attempt to get the man out of java he ask each of they if he wish to take the chance and every one agree
 he first have to get the twelve man to the sea coast fifty mile away to do this he have to improvise stretcher for the hazardous journey the man be suffer severely but dr. wassell keep they alive by his skill and inspire they by his own courage
 and as the official report say dr. wassell be almost like a christ like shepherd devote to his flock
 on the sea coast he embark the man on a little dutch ship they be bomb and they be machine gun by wave of japanese plane dr. wassell take virtual command of the ship and by great skill avoid destruction hide in small little bay and little inlet
 a few day later dr. wassell and his little small flock of wounded man reach australia safely
 and today dr. wassell now wear the navy cross
 another story concern a ship a ship rather than an individual man
 you may remember the tragic sinking of the submarine the u.s.s. squalus off the new england coast in the summer of 1939 some of the crew be lose but other be save by the speed and the efficiency of the surface rescue crew the squalus itself be tediously raise from the bottom of the ocean sea
 she be repair and put back into commission and eventually she sail again under a new name the u.s.s. sailfish today she be a potent and effective unit of our submarine fleet in the southwest pacific
 the sailfish have cover many thousand of mile in operation in the those western pacific water
 she have sink a japanese destroyer
 she have torpedo a japanese cruiser
 she have make two torpedo hit two of they on a japanese aircraft carrier
 three of the enlisted man of our navy who go down with the squalus in 1939 and be rescue be today serve on the same ship the u.s.s. sailfish in this war
 it seem to i that it be hearten to know that the squalus once give up as lose rise from the depth to fight for our country in time of peril
 one more story which that i hear only this morning
 this be a story of one of our army flying fortresses operate in the western pacific the pilot of this plane be a modest young man proud of his crew for one of the tough fight a bomber have yet experience
 the bomber depart from its base as part or a flight of five bomber to attack japanese transport which that be land troop against we in the philippines when they have go about halfway to their destination one of the motor of this bomber go out of commission the young pilot lose contact with the other bomber the crew however get the motor work get it go again and the plane proceed on its mission alone
 by the time it arrive at its target the other four flying fortresses have already pass over have drop their bomb and have stir up the hornet nest of japanese zero plane eighteen of they these zero fighter attack our one flying fortress despite this mass attack our plane proceed on its mission and drop all of its bomb on six japanese transport which be line up along the dock
 as it turn back on its homeward journey a running fight between the bomber and the eighteen japanese pursuit plane continue for seventy five mile four pursuit ship plane of the japs attack simultaneously at each side and four be shoot down with the side gun during this fight the bomber 's radio operator be kill the engineer 's right hand be shoot off and one gunner be crippled leave only one man available to operate both side gun although wound in one hand this the gunner alternately man both side gun bring down three more japanese zero plane while this be go on one engine on the american bomber be shoot out one gas tank be hit the radio be shoot off and the oxygen system be entirely destroy out of eleven control cable all but four be shoot away the rear landing wheel be blow off entirely and the two front wheel be both shoot flat
 the fight continue until the remain japanese pursuit ship exhaust their ammunition and turn back with two engine go and the plane practically out of control the american bomber return to its base after dark and make an emergency landing the mission have be accomplish
 the name of that pilot be captain hewitt t. wheless of the united states army he come from a place call menard texas with a population 2,375 he have be award the distinguished service cross and i hope that he be listen
 these story i have tell you be not exceptional they be typical example of individual heroism and skill
 as we here at home contemplate our own duty our own responsibility let we think and think hard of the example which be be set for we by our fight man
 our soldier and sailor be member of well discipline unit but they be still and forever individual free individual they be farmer and worker businessman professional man artist clerk
 they be the united states of america
 that be why they fight
 we too be the united states of america
 that be why we must work and sacrifice
 it be for they it be for we it be for victory

my friend
 i wish that all the americans people could read all the citation for various medal recommend for our soldier and sailor and marine i be pick out one of these citation which tell of the accomplishment of lieutenant john james powers united states navy during three day of the battle with japanese force in the coral sea
 during the first two day lieutenant powers fly a dive bomber in the face of blast enemy anti aircraft fire demolish one large enemy gunboat put another gunboat out of commission severely damage an aircraft tender and a twenty thousand ton transport and score a direct hit on an aircraft carrier which burst into flame and sink soon after
 the official citation then describe the morning of the third day of battle as the pilot of his squadron leave the ready room to man their plane lieutenant powers say to they remember the folk back home be count on we i be go to get a hit if i have to lay it on their flight deck
 he lead his section down to the target from an altitude of 18,000 foot through a wall of burst anti aircraft shell and swarm of enemy plane he dive almost to the very deck of the enemy carrier and do not release his bomb until he be sure of a direct hit he be last see attempt recovery from his dive at the extremely low altitude of two hundred foot amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragment and smoke and flame and debris from the stricken vessel his own plane be destroy by the explosion of his own bomb but he have make good his promise to lay it on the flight deck
 i have receive a recommendation from the secretary of the navy that lieutenant john james powers of new york city miss in action be award the medal of honor i hereby and now make this award
 you and i be the folk back home for whose protection lieutenant powers fight and repeatedly risk his life he say that we count on he and his man we do not count in vain but have not those man a right to be count on we how be we play our part back home in win this war
 the answer be that we be not do enough
 today i send a message to the congress point out the overwhelming urgency of the serious domestic economic crisis with which we be threaten some call it inflation which be a vague sort of term and other call it a rise in the cost of living which be much more easily understand by most family
 that phrase the cost of living mean essentially what a dollar can buy
 from january 1 1941 to may of this year nearly a year and a half the cost of living go up about 15 and at that point last may we undertake to freeze the cost of living but we could not do a complete job of it because the congressional authority at the time exempt a large part of farm product use for food and for make clothing although several week before i have ask the congress for legislation to stabilize all farm price
 at that time i have tell the congress that there be seven element in our national economy all of which have to be control and that if any one essential element remain exempt the cost of living could not be hold down
 on only two of these point both of they vital however do i call for congressional action these two vital point be first taxation and second the stabilization of all farm price at parity
 parity be a standard for the maintenance of good farm price it be establish as our national policy way back in 1933 it mean that the farmer and the city worker be on the same relative ratio with each other in purchase power as they be during a period some thirty year ago before at a time then the farmer have a satisfactory purchasing power 100 percent of parity therefore have be accept by farmer as the fair standard for the price they receive
 last january however the congress pass a law forbid ceiling on farm price below 110 percent of parity on some commodity and on other commodity the ceiling be even high so that the average possible ceiling be now about 116 percent of parity for agricultural product as a whole
 this act of favoritism for one particular group in the community increase the cost of food to everybody not only to the worker in the city or in the munition plant and their family but also to the family of the farmer themselves
 since last may ceiling have be set on nearly all commodity rent and service except the exempted farm product installment buying for example have be effectively effectually stabilize and control
 wage in certain key industry have be stabilize on the basis of the present cost of living
 but it be obvious to all of we however that if the cost of food continue to go up as it be do at present the wage earner particularly in the low bracket will have a right to an increase in his wage i think that would be essential justice and a practical necessity
 our experience with the control of other price during the past few month have bring out one important fact the rise cost of living can be control provide that all element make up the cost of living be control at the same time i think that also be an essential justice and a practical necessity we know that parity price for farm product not now control will not put up the cost of live more than a very small amount but we also know that if we must go up to an average of 116 of parity for food and other farm product which be necessary at present under the emergency price control act before we can control all farm price the cost of living will get well out of hand we be face to face with this danger today let we meet it and remove it
 i realize that it may seem out of proportion to you to be worry about over stress these economic problem at a time like this when we be all deeply concerned about the news from far distant field of battle but i give you the solemn assurance that failure to solve this problem here at home and to solve it now will make more difficult the winning of this war
 if the vicious spiral of inflation ever get under way the whole economic system will stagger price and wage will go up so rapidly that the entire production program will be endanger the cost of the war pay by taxpayer will jump beyond all present calculation it will mean an uncontrollable rise in price and in wage which can result in raise the overall cost of live as high as another 20 percent soon that would mean that the purchase power of every dollar that you have in your pay envelope or in the bank or include in your insurance policy or your pension would be reduce to about eighty cent worth i need not tell you that this would have a demoralizing effect on our people soldier and civilian alike
 overall stabilization of price and salary and wage and profit be necessary to the continue increase production of plane and tank and ship and gun
 in my message to congress today i have tell the congress say that this must be do quickly if we wait for two or three or four or six month it may well be too late
 i have tell the congress that the administration can not hold the actual cost of food and clothing down to the present level beyond october first
 therefore i have ask the congress to pass legislation under which the president would be specifically authorize to stabilize the cost of living include the price of all farm commodity the purpose should be to hold farm price at parity or at level of a recent date whichever be high the purpose should also be to keep wage at a point stabilize with today 's cost of living both must be regulate at the same time and neither one of they can or should be regulate without the other
 at the same time that farm price be stabilize i will stabilize wage
 that be plain justice and plain common sense
 and so i have ask the congress to take this action by the first of october we must now act with the dispatch which the stern necessity of war require
 i have tell the congress that inaction on their part by that date will leave i with an inescapable responsibility a responsibility to the people of this country to see to it that the war effort be no long imperil by the threat of economic chaos
 as i say in my message to the congress
 in the event that the congress should fail to act and act adequately i shall accept the responsibility and i will act
 the president have the power under the constitution and under congressional act to take measure necessary to avert a disaster which would interfere with the winning of the war
 i have give the most careful and thoughtful consideration to meet this issue without further reference to the congress i have determine however on this vital matter to consult with the congress
 there may be those who will say that if the situation be as grave as i have state it to be i should use my power and act now i can only say that i have approach this problem from every angle and that i have decide that the course of conduct which i be follow in this case be consistent with my sense of responsibility as president in time of war and with my deep and unalterable devotion to the process of democracy
 the responsibility of the president in wartime to protect the nation be very grave this total war with our fighting front all over the world make the use of the executive power far more essential than in any previous war
 if we be invade the people of this country would expect the president to use any and all mean to repel the invader
 now the revolution and the war between the states be fight on our own soil but today this war will be win or lose on other continent and in remote sea i can not tell what power may have to be exercise in order to win this war
 the american people can be sure that i will use my power with a full sense of responsibility to the constitution and to my country the american people can also be sure that i shall not hesitate to use every power vest in i to accomplish the defeat of our enemy in any part of the world where our own safety demand such defeat
 and when the war be win the power under which i act will automatically revert to the people of the united states to the people to whom they those power belong
 i think i know the american farmer i know that they be as wholehearte in their patriotism as any other group they have suffer from the constant fluctuation of farm price occasionally too high more often too low nobody know well than farmer the disastrous effect of wartime inflationary boom and post war deflationary panic
 so i have also suggest today suggest that the congress make our agricultural economy more stable i have recommend that in addition to put ceiling on all farm product now we also place a definite floor under those price for a period begin now continue through the war and for as long as necessary after the war in this way we will be able to avoid the collapse of farm price which that happen after the last war the farmer must be assure of a fair minimum price during the readjustment period which will follow the great excessive world food demand which that now prevail
 we must have some floor under farm price as we must have under wage if we be to avoid the danger of a post war inflation on the one hand or the catastrophe of a crash in farm price and wage on the other
 today i have also advise the congress of the importance of speed up the passage of the tax bill the federal treasury be lose million of dollar a each and every day because the bill have not yet be pass taxation be the only practical way of prevent the income and profit of individual and corporation from get too high
 i have tell the congress once more that all net individual income after payment of all taxis should be limit effectively by further taxation to a maximum net income of $ 25,000 25 thousand dollar a year and it be equally important that corporate profit should not exceed a reasonable amount in any case
 the nation must have more money to run the war people must stop spend for luxury our country need a far great share of our income
 for this be a global war and it will cost this nation nearly one hundred billion dollar in 1943
 in that global war there be now four main area of combat and i should like to speak briefly of they not in the order of their importance for all of they be vital and all of they be interrelate
 1 the russian front here the germans be still unable to gain the smashing victory which almost a year ago hitler announce he have already achieve germany have be able to capture important russian territory nevertheless hitler have be unable to destroy a single russian army and this you may be sure have be and still be his main objective million of german troop seem doom to spend another cruel and bitter winter on the russian front yes the russians be kill more nazi and destroy more airplane and tank than be be smash on any other front they be fight not only bravely but brilliantly in spite of any setback russia will hold out and with the help of her allies will ultimately drive every nazi from her soil
 2 the pacific ocean area this area must be group together as a whole --every part of it land and sea we have stop one major japanese offensive and we have inflict heavy loss on their fleet but they still possess great strength they seek to keep the initiative and they will undoubtedly strike hard again we must not over rate the importance of our success in the solomon islands though we may be proud of the skill with which these local operation be conduct at the same time we need not under rate the significance of our victory at midway there we stop the major japanese offensive
 3 in the mediterranean and the middle east area the british together with the south africans australians new zealanders indian troop and other of the united nations include ourselves be fight a desperate battle with the germans and italians the axis power be fight to gain control of that area dominate the mediterranean and the indian ocean and gain contact with the japanese navy the battle in the middle east be now join we be well aware of our danger but we be hopeful of the outcome
 4 the european area here the aim be an offensive against germany there be at least a dozen different point at which attack can be launch you of course do not expect i to give detail of future plan but you can rest assure that preparation be be make here and in britain toward this purpose the power of germany must be break on the battlefield of europe
 various people urge that we concentrate our force on one or another of these four area although no one suggest that any one of the four area should be abandon certainly it could not be seriously urge that we abandon aid to russia or that we surrender all of the pacific to japan or the mediterranean and middle east to germany or give up an offensive against germany the american people may be sure that we shall neglect none of the four great theater of war
 certain vital military decision have be make in due time you will know what these decision be and so will our enemy i can say now that all of these decision be direct toward take the offensive
 today exactly nine month after pearl harbor we have send overseas three time more man than we transport to france in the first nine month of the first world war we have do this in spite of great danger and few ship and every week see a gain in the actual number of american man and weapon in the fighting area these reinforcement in man and munition be continue and will continue to go forward
 this war will finally be win by the coordination of all the army navy and air force of all of the united nations operate in unison against our enemy
 this will require vast assembly of weapon and man at all the vital point of attack we and our ally have work for year to achieve superiority in weapon we have no doubt about the superiority of our man we glory in the individual exploit of our soldier our sailor our marine our merchant seaman lieutenant john james powers be one of these and there be thousand of other in the force of the united nations
 several thousand americans have meet death in battle other thousand will lose their life but many million stand ready to step into their place to engage in a struggle to the very death for they know that the enemy be determined to destroy we our home and our institution that in this war it be kill or be kill
 battle be not win by soldier or sailor who think first of their own personal safety and war be not win by people who be concern primarily with their own comfort their own convenience their own pocketbook
 we americans of today bear the gravest of responsibility and all of the united nations share they
 all of we here at home be be test for our fortitude for our selfless devotion to our country and to our cause
 this be the tough war of all time we need not leave it to historian of the future to answer the question whether we be tough enough to meet this unprecedented challenge we can give that answer now the answer be yes

my fellow americans
 as you know i have recently come back from a trip of inspection of camp and training station and war factory
 the main thing that i observe on this trip be not exactly news it be the plain fact that the american people be unite as never before in their determination to do a job and to do it well
 this whole nation of one hundred and thirty million free man woman and child be become one great fighting force some of we be soldier or sailor some of we be civilian some of we be fight the war in airplane five mile above the continent of europe or the island of the pacific and some of we be fight it in mine deep doom in the earth of pennsylvania or montana a few of we be decorate with medal for heroic achievement but all of we can have that deep and permanent inner satisfaction that come from do the good we know how each of we play an honorable part in the great struggle to save our democratic civilization
 whatever our individual circumstance or opportunity -we be all in it and our spirit be good and we americans and our ally be go to win and do not let anyone tell you anything different
 that be the main thing that i see on my trip around the country unbeatable spirit if the leader of germany and japan could have come along with i and have see what i see they would agree with my conclusion unfortunately they be unable to make the trip with i and that be one reason why we be carry our war effort overseas to they
 with every passing week the war increase in scope and intensity that be true in europe in africa in asia and on all the sea
 the strength of the united nations be on the upgrade in this war the axis leader on the other hand know by now that they have already reach their full strength and that their steadily mount loss in man and material can not be fully replace germany and japan be already realize what the inevitable result will be when the total strength of the united nations hit they at additional place on the earth 's surface
 one of the principal weapon of our enemy in the past have be their use of what be call the war of nerves they have spread falsehood and terror they have start fifth columns everywhere they have dupe the innocent they have foment suspicion and hate between neighbor they have aid and abet those people in other nation even include our own whose word and deed be advertise from berlin and from tokyo as proof of our disunity
 the great defense against all such propaganda of course be the common sense of the common people and that defense be prevail
 the war of nerves against the united nations be now turn into a boomerang for the first time the nazi propaganda machine be on the defensive they begin to apologize to their own people for the repulse of their vast force at stalingrad and for the enormous casualty they be suffer they be compel to beg their overworked people to rally their weakened production they even publicly admit for the first time that germany can be feed only at the cost of steal food from the rest of europe
 they be proclaim that a second front be impossible but at the same time they be desperately rush troop in all direction and string barbed wire all the way from the coast of finland and norway to the island of the eastern mediterranean meanwhile they be drive to increase the fury of their atrocity
 the united nations have decide to establish the identity of those nazi leader who be responsible for the innumerable act of savagery as each of these criminal deed be commit it be be carefully investigate and the evidence be be relentlessly pile up for the future purpose of justice
 we have make it entirely clear that the united nations seek no mass reprisal against the population of germany or italy or japan but the ring leader and their brutal henchman must be name and apprehend and try in accordance with the judicial process of criminal law
 there be now million of americans in army camp in naval station in factory and in shipyard
 who be these million upon whom the life of our country depend what be they think what be their doubt and what be their hope and how be the work progress
 the commander in chief can not learn all of the answer to these question in washington and that be why i make the trip i do
 it be very easy to say as some have say that when the president travel through the country he should go with a blare of trumpet with crowd on the sidewalk with battery of reporter and photographer talk and pose with all of the politician of the land
 but having have some experience in this war and in the last war i can tell you very simply that the kind of trip i took permit i to concentrate on the work i have to do without expend time meet all the demand of publicity and i might add it be a particular pleasure to make a tour of the country without have to give a single thought to politic
 i expect to make other trip for similar purpose and i shall make they in the same way
 in the last war i have see great factory but until i see some of the new present day plant i have not thoroughly visualize our american war effort of course i see only a small portion of all our plant but that portion be a good cross section and it be deeply impressive
 the united states have be at war for only ten month and be engage in the enormous task of multiply its armed force many time we be by no mean at full production level yet but i could not help ask myself on the trip where would we be today if the government of the united states have not begin to build many of its factory for this huge increase more than two year ago more than a year before war be force upon we at pearl harbor
 we have also have to face the problem of shipping ship in every part of the world continue to be sink by enemy action but the total tonnage of ship come out of american canadian and british shipyard day by day have increase so fast that we be get ahead of our enemy in the bitter battle of transportation
 in expand our shipping we have have to enlist many thousand of man for our merchant marine these man be serve magnificently they be risk their life every hour so that gun and tank and plane and ammunition and food may be carry to the heroic defender of stalingrad and to all the united nations force all over the world
 a few day ago i award the first maritime distinguished service medal to a young man edward f. cheney of yeadon pennsylvania who have show great gallantry in rescue his comrade from the oily water of the sea after their ship have be torpedo there will be many more such act of bravery
 in one sense my recent trip be a hurried one out through the middle west to the northwest down the length of the pacific coast and back through the southwest and the south in another sense however it be a leisurely trip because i have the opportunity to talk to the people who be actually do the work management and labor alike on their own home ground and it give i a fine chance to do some think about the major problem of our war effort on the basis of first thing first
 as i tell the three press association representative who accompany i i be impress by the large proportion of woman employ do skilled manual work labor run machine as time go on and many more of our man enter the armed force this proportion of woman will increase within less than a year from now i think there will probably be as many woman as man work in our war production plant
 i have some enlightening experience relate to the old saying of we man that curiosity inquisitiveness be strong among woman i notice that frequently that when we drive unannounced down the middle aisle of a great plant full of worker and machine the first people to look up from their work be the man and not the woman it be chiefly the man who be argue as to whether that fellow in the straw hat be really the president or not
 so having see the quality of the work and of the worker on our production line and couple these firsthand observation with the report of actual performance of our weapon on the fighting front i can say to you that we be get ahead of our enemy in the battle of production
 and of great importance to our future production be the effective and rapid manner in which the congress meet the serious problem of the rise cost of living it be a splendid example of the operation of democratic process in wartime
 the machinery to carry out this act of the congress be put into effect within twelve hour after the bill be sign the legislation will help the cost of living problem of every worker in every factory and on every farm in the land
 in order to keep step up our production we have have to add million of worker to the total labor force of the nation and as new factory come into operation we must find additional million of worker
 this present a formidable problem in the mobilization of manpower
 it be not that we do not have enough people in this country to do the job the problem be to have the right number of the right people in the right place at the right time
 we be learn to ration material and we must now learn to ration manpower
 the major objective of a sound manpower policy be
 first to select and train man of the high fighting efficiency need for our armed force in the achievement of victory over our enemy in combat
 second to man our war industry and farm with the worker need to produce the arm and munition and food require by ourselves and by our fight ally to win this war
 in order to do this we shall be compel to stop worker from move from one war job to another as a matter of personal preference to stop employer from steal labor from each other to use old man and handicapped people and more woman and even grow boy and girl wherever possible and reasonable to replace man of military age and fitness to train new personnel for essential war work and to stop the wastage of labor in all non essential activity
 there be many other thing that we can do and do immediately to help meet the this manpower problem
 the school authority in all the state should work out plan to enable our high school student to take some time from their school year and to use their summer vacation to help farmer raise and harvest their crop or to work somewhere in the war industry this do not mean closing school and stop education it do mean give old student a well opportunity to contribute their bit to the war effort such work will do no harm to the student
 people should do their work as near their home as possible we can not afford to transport a single worker into an area where there be already a worker available to do the job
 in some community employer dislike to employ woman in other they be reluctant to hire negro in still other old man be not want we can no long afford to indulge such prejudice or practice
 every citizen want to know what essential war work he can do the good he can get the answer by apply to the near united states employment service office there be four thousand five hundred of these office throughout the nation they be form the corner grocery store of our manpower system this network of employment office be prepared to advise every citizen where his skill and labor be need most and to refer he to an employer who can utilize they to good advantage in the war effort
 perhaps the most difficult phase of the manpower problem be the scarcity of farm labor in many place i have see evidence of the fact however that the people be try to meet it as well as possible
 in one community that i visit a perishable crop be harvest by turn out the whole of the high school for three or four day
 and in another community of fruit grower the usual japanese labor be not available but when the fruit ripen the banker the butcher the lawyer the garage man the druggist the local editor and in fact every able bodied man and woman in the town leave their occupation and go out gathering(ed the fruit and send it to market
 every farmer in the land must realize fully that his production be part of war production and that he be regard by the nation as essential to victory the american people expect he to keep his production up and even to increase it we will use every effort to help he to get labor but at the same time he and the people of his community must use ingenuity and cooperative effort to produce crop and livestock and dairy product
 it may be that all of our volunteer effort however well intentione and well administer will not suffice wholly to solve the this problem in that case we shall have to adopt new legislation and if this be necessary i do not believe that the american people will shrink from it
 in a sense every american because of the privilege of his citizenship be a part of the selective service
 the nation owe a debt of gratitude to the selective service boards the successful operation of the selective service system and the way it have be accept by the great mass of our citizen give we confidence that if necessary the same principle could be use to solve any manpower problem
 and i want to say also a word of praise and thank for to the more than ten million people all over the country who have volunteer for the work of civilian defense and who be work hard at it they be display unselfish devotion in the patient performance of their often tiresome and always anonymous task in do this important neighborly work they be help to fortify our national unity and our real understanding of the fact that we be all involve in this war
 naturally on my trip i be most interested in watch the training of our fighting force
 all of our combat unit that go overseas must consist of young strong man who have have thorough training a an army division that have an average age of twenty three or twenty four be a well fighting unit than one which have an average age of thirty three or thirty four the more of such troop we have in the field the soon the war will be win and the small will be the cost in casualty
 therefore i believe that it will be necessary to lower the present minimum age limit for selective service from twenty year down to eighteen we have learn how inevitable that be and how important to the speeding up of victory
 i can very thoroughly understand the feeling of all parent whose son have enter our armed force i have an appreciation of that feeling and so have my wife
 i want every father and every mother who have a son in the service to know --again from what i have see with my own eye that the man in the army navy and marine corps be receive today the well possible training equipment and medical care and we will never fail to provide for the spiritual need of our officer and man under the chaplains of our armed service
 good training will save many many life in battle the high rate of casualty be always suffer by unit comprise of inadequately train man
 we can be sure that the combat unit of our army and navy be well man and well equip and well train their effectiveness in action will depend upon the quality of their leadership and upon the wisdom of the strategic plan on which all military operation be base
 i can say one thing about our these plan of our they be not be decide by the typewriter strategist who expound their view in the press or on the radio
 one of the great of american soldier robert e. lee once remark on the tragic fact that in the war of his day all of the good general be apparently work on newspaper instead of in the army and that seem to be true in all war
 the trouble with the typewriter strategist be that while they may be full of bright idea they be not in possession of much information about the fact or problem of military operation
 we therefore will continue to leave the plan for this war to the military leader
 the military and naval plan of the united states be make by the joint staff of the army and navy which be constantly in session in washington the chiefs of this staff be admiral leahy general marshall admiral king and general arnold they meet and confer regularly with representative of the british joint staff and with representative of russia china the netherlands poland norway the british dominions and other nation work in the common cause
 since this unity of operation be put into effect last january there have be a very substantial agreement between these planner all of whom be train in the profession of arm air sea and land from their early year as commander in chief i have at all time also be in substantial agreement
 as i have say before many major decision of strategy have be make one of they on which we have all agree relate to the necessity of divert enemy force from russia and china to other theater of war by new offensive against germany and japan an announcement of how these offensive be to be launch and when and where can not be broadcast over the radio at this time
 we be celebrat(e)e today the exploit of a bold and adventurous italian --christopher columbus who with the aid of spain open up a new world where freedom and tolerance and respect for human right and dignity provide an asylum for the oppressed of the old world
 today the son of the new world be fight in land far distant from their own america they be fight to save for all mankind include ourselves the principle which have flourish in this new world of freedom
 we be mindful of the countless million of people whose future liberty and whose very life depend upon permanent victory for the united nations
 there be a few people in this country who when the collapse of the axis begin will tell our people that we be safe once more that we can tell the rest of the world to stew in its own juice that never again will we help to pull the other fellow 's chestnut from the fire that the future of civilization can jolly well take care of itself insofar as we be concern
 but it be useless to win battle if the cause for which we fight these battle be lose it be useless to win a war unless it stay win
 we therefore fight for the restoration and perpetuation of faith and hope and peace throughout the world
 the objective of today be clear and realistic it be to destroy completely the military power of germany italy and japan to such good purpose that their threat against we and all the other united nations can not be revive a generation hence
 we be unite in seek the kind of victory that will guarantee that our grandchild can grow and under gods may live their life free from the constant threat of invasion destruction slavery and violent death

mr. vice president mr. speaker member of the 78th congress

 this 78th congress assemble in one of the great moment in the history of the nation the past year be perhaps the most crucial for modern civilization the come year will be fill with violent conflict yet with high promise of well thing

 we must appraise the event of 1942 accord to their relative importance we must exercise a sense of proportion

 first in importance in the american scene have be the inspiring proof of the great quality of our fight man they have demonstrate these quality in adversity as well as in victory as long as our flag fly over this capitol americans will honor the soldier sailor and marine who fight our first battle of this war against overwhelming odd the hero living and dead of wake and bataan and guadalcanal of the java sea and midway and the north atlantic convoy their unconquerable spirit will live forever

 by far the large and most important development in the whole worldwide strategic picture of 1942 be the event of the long front in russia first the implacable defense of stalingrad and second the offensive by the russian army at various point that start in the latter part of november and which still roll on with great force and effectiveness

 the other major event of the year be the series of japanese advance in the philippines the east indies malaya and burma the stopping of that japanese advance in the mid pacific the south pacific and the indian oceans the successful defense of the near east by the british counterattack through egypt and libya the american british occupation of north africa of continue importance in the year 1942 be the unending and bitterly contest battle of the convoy route and the gradual passing of air superiority from the axis to the united nations

 the axis power know that they must win the war in 1942 or eventually lose everything i do not need to tell you that our enemy do not win the war in 1942

 in the pacific area our most important victory in 1942 be the air and naval battle off midway island that action be historically important because it secure for our use communication line stretch thousand of mile in every direction in place this emphasis on the battle of midway i be not unmindful of other successful action in the pacific in the air and on land and afloat especially those on the coral sea and new guinea and in the solomon islands but these action be essentially defensive they be part of the delaying strategy that characterize this phase of the war

 during this period we inflict steady loss upon the enemy great loss of japanese plane and naval vessel transport and cargo ship as early as one year ago we set as a primary task in the war of the pacific a day by day and week by week and month by month destruction of more japanese war material than japanese industry could replace most certainly that task have be and be be perform by our fighting ship and plane and a large part of this task have be accomplish by the gallant crew of our american submarine who strike on the other side of the pacific at japanese ship right up at the very mouth of the harbor of yokohama

 we know that as each day go by japanese strength in ship and plane be go down and down and american strength in ship and plane be go up and up and so i sometimes feel that the eventual outcome can now be put on a mathematical basis that will become evident to the japanese people themselves when we strike at their own home island and bomb they constantly from the air

 and in the attack against japan we shall be join with the heroic people of china that great people whose ideal of peace be so closely akin to our own even today we be fly as much lend lease material into china as ever traverse the burma road fly it over mountain 17,000 foot high fly blind through sleet and snow we shall overcome all the formidable obstacle and get the battle equipment into china to shatter the power of our common enemy from this war china will realize the security the prosperity and the dignity which japan have seek so ruthlessly to destroy

 the period of our defensive attrition in the pacific be draw to a close now our aim be to force the japanese to fight last year we stop they this year we intend to advance

 turn now to the european theater of war during this past year it be clear that our first task be to lessen the concentrated pressure on the russian front by compelling germany to divert part of her manpower and equipment to another theater of war after month of secret planning and preparation in the utmost detail an enormous amphibious expedition be embark for french north africa from the united states and the united kingdom in literally hundred of ship it reach its objective with very small loss and have already produce an important effect upon the whole situation of the war it have open to attack what mr. churchill well describe as the underbelly of the axis and it have remove the always dangerous threat of an axis attack through west africa against the south atlantic ocean and the continent of south america itself

 the well time and splendidly execute offensive from egypt by the british 8th army be a part of the same major strategy of the united nations

 great rain and appal mud and very limited communication have delay the final battle of tunisia the axis be reinforce its strong position but i be confident that though the fighting will be tough when the final allied assault be make the last vestige of axis power will be drive from the whole of the south shore of the mediterranean

 any review of the year 1942 must emphasize the magnitude and the diversity of the military activity in which this nation have become engaged as i speak to you approximately one and a half million of our soldier sailor marine and flier be in service outside of our continental limit all through the world our merchant seaman in addition be carry supply to they and to our ally over every sea lane

 few americans realize the amazing growth of our air strength though i be sure our enemy do day in and day out our force be bomb the enemy and meet he in combat on many different front in every part of the world and for those who question the quality of our aircraft and the ability of our flier i point to the fact that in africa we be shoot down two enemy plane to every one we lose and in the pacific and the southwest pacific we be shoot they down four to one

 we pay great tribute the tribute of the united states of america to the fight man of russia and china and britain and the various member of the british commonwealth the million of man who through the year of this war have fight our common enemy and have deny to they the world conquest which they seek

 we pay tribute to the soldier and flier and seaman of other of the united nations whose country have be overrun by axis horde

 as a result of the allied occupation of north africa powerful unit of the french army and navy be go into action they be in action with the united nations force we welcome they as ally and as friend they join with those frenchmen who since the dark day of june 1940 have be fight valiantly for the liberation of their stricken country

 we pay tribute to the fight leader of our ally to winston churchill to joseph stalin and to the generalissimo chiang kai shek yes there be a very great unanimity between the leader of the united nations this unity be effective in plan and carry out the major strategy of this war and in build up and in maintain the line of supply

 i can not prophesy i can not tell you when or where the united nations be go to strike next in europe but we be go to strike and strike hard i can not tell you whether we be go to hit they in norway or through the low countries or in france or through sardinia or sicily or through the balkans or through poland or at several point simultaneously but i can tell you that no matter where and when we strike by land we and the british and the russians will hit they from the air heavily and relentlessly day in and day out we shall heap ton upon ton of high explosive on their war factory and utility and seaport

 hitler and mussolini will understand now the enormity of their miscalculation that the nazis would always have the advantage of superior air power as they do when they bomb warsaw and rotterdam and london and coventry that superiority have go forever

 yes the nazis and the fascists have ask for it and they be go to get it

 our forward progress in this war have depend upon our progress on the production front

 there have be criticism of the management and conduct of our war production much of this self criticism have have a healthy effect it have spur we on it have reflect a normal american impatience to get on with the job we be the kind of people who be never quite satisfied with anything short of miracle

 but there have be some criticism base on guesswork and even on malicious falsification of fact such criticism create doubt and create fear and weaken our total effort

 i do not wish to suggest that we should be completely satisfied with our production progress today or next month or ever but i can report to you with genuine pride on what have be accomplish in 1942

 a year ago we set certain production goal for 1942 and for 1943 some people include some expert think that we have pull some big figure out of a hat just to frighten the axis but we have confidence in the ability of our people to establish new record and that confidence have be justify

 of course we realize that some production objective would have to be change some of they adjust upward and other downward some item would be take out of the program altogether and other add this be inevitable as we gain battle experience and as technological improvement be make

 our 1942 airplane production and tank production fall short numerically stress the word numerically of the goal set a year ago nevertheless we have plenty of reason to be proud of our record for 1942 we produce 48,000 military plane more than the airplane production of germany italy and japan put together last month in december we produce 5,500 military plane and the rate be rapidly rise furthermore we must remember that as each month pass by the average of our type weigh more take more man hour to make and have more striking power

 in tank production we revise our schedule and for good and sufficient reason as a result of hard experience in battle we have divert a portion of our tank produce capacity to a step up production of new deadly field weapon especially self propel artillery

 here be some other production figure

 in 1942 we produce 56,000 combat vehicle such as tank and self propel artillery

 in 1942 we produce 670,000 machine gun six time great than our production in 1941 and three time great than our total production during the year and a half of our participation in the first world war

 we produce 21,000 anti tank gun six time great than our 1941 production

 we produce ten and a quarter billion round of small arm ammunition five time great than our 1941 production and three time great than our total production in the first world war

 we produce 181 million round of artillery ammunition 12 time great than our 1941 production and 10 time great than our total production in the first world war

 i think the arsenal of democracy be make good

 these fact and figure that i have give will give no great aid and comfort to the enemy on the contrary i can imagine that they will give he considerable discomfort i suspect that hitler and tojo will find it difficult to explain to the german and japanese people just why it be that decadent inefficient democracy can produce such phenomenal quantity of weapon and munition and fight man

 we have give the lie to certain misconception which be an extremely polite word especially the one which hold that the various bloc or group within a free country can not forego their political and economic difference in time of crisis and work together toward a common goal

 while we have be achieve this miracle of production during the past year our armed force have grow from a little over 2,000,000 to 7,000,000 in other word we have withdraw from the labor force and the farm some 5,000,000 of our young worker and in spite of this our farmer have contribute their share to the common effort by produce the great quantity of food ever make available during a single year in all our history

 i wonder be there any person among we so simple as to believe that all this could have be do without create some dislocation in our normal national life some inconvenience and even some hardship

 who can have hope to have do this without burdensome government regulation which be a nuisance to everyone include those who have the thankless task of administer they

 we all know that there have be mistake mistake due to the inevitable process of trial and error inherent in do big thing for the first time we all know that there have be too many complicated form and questionnaire i know about that i have have to fill some of they out myself

 but we be determined to see to it that our supply of food and other essential civilian good be distribute on a fair and just basis to rich and poor management and labor farmer and city dweller alike we be determined to keep the cost of live at a stable level all this have require much information these form and questionnaire represent an honest and sincere attempt by honest and sincere official to obtain this information

 we have learn by the mistake that we have make

 our experience will enable we during the come year to improve the necessary mechanism of wartime economic control and to simplify administrative procedure but we do not intend to leave thing so lax that loophole will be leave for cheater for chiseler or for the manipulator of the black market

 of course there have be disturbance and inconvenience and even hardship and there will be many many more before we finally win yes 1943 will not be an easy year for we on the home front we shall feel in many way in our daily live the sharp pinch of total war

 fortunately there be only a few americans who place appetite above patriotism the overwhelming majority realize that the food we send abroad be for essential military purpose for our own and allied fighting force and for necessary help in area that we occupy

 we americans intend to do this great job together in our common labor we must build and fortify the very foundation of national unity confidence in one another

 it be often amusing and it be sometimes politically profitable to picture the city of washington as a madhouse with the congress and the administration disrupt with confusion and indecision and general incompetence

 however what matter most in war be result and the one pertinent fact be that after only a few year of preparation and only one year of warfare we be able to engage spiritually as well as physically in the total waging of a total war

 washington may be a madhouse but only in the sense that it be the capital city of a nation which be fight mad and i think that berlin and rome and tokyo which have such contempt for the obsolete method of democracy would now gladly use all they could get of that same brand of madness

 and we must not forget that our achievement in production have be relatively no great than those of the russians and the british and the chinese who have develop their own war industry under the incredible difficulty of battle condition they have have to continue work through bombing and blackout and they have never quit

 we americans be in good brave company in this war and we be play our own honorable part in the vast common effort

 as spokesman for the united states government you and i take off our hat to those responsible for our american production to the owner manager and supervisor to the draftsman and the engineer and to the worker man and woman in factory and arsenal and shipyard and mine and mill and forest and railroad and on highway

 we take off our hat to the farmer who have face an unprecedented task of feed not only a great nation but a great part of the world

 we take off our hat to all the loyal anonymous untire man and woman who have work in private employment and in government and who have endure rationing and other stringency with good humor and good will

 yes we take off our hat to all americans who have contribute so magnificently to our common cause

 i have seek to emphasize a sense of proportion in this review of the event of the war and the need of the war

 we should never forget the thing we be fight for but at this critical period of the war we should confine ourselves to the large objective and not get bogge down in argument over method and detail

 we and all the united nations want a decent peace and a durable peace in the year between the end of the first world war and the beginning of the second world war we be not live under a decent or a durable peace

 i have reason to know that our boy at the front be concern with two broad aim beyond the winning of the war and their thinking and their opinion coincide with what most americans here back home be mull over they know and we know that it would be inconceivable it would indeed be sacrilegious if this nation and the world do not attain some real last good out of all these effort and suffering and bloodshed and death

 the man in our armed force want a last peace and equally they want permanent employment for themselves their family and their neighbor when they be muster out at the end of the war

 two year ago i speak in my annual message of four freedom the blessing of two of they freedom of speech and freedom of religion be an essential part of the very life of this nation and we hope that these blessing will be grant to all man everywhere

 the people at home and the people at the front be wonder a little about the third freedom freedom from want to they it mean that when they be muster out when war production be convert to the economy of peace they will have the right to expect full employment full employment for themselves and for all able bodied man and woman in america who want to work

 they expect the opportunity to work to run their farm their store to earn decent wage they be eager to face the risk inherent in our system of free enterprise

 they do not want a postwar america which suffer from undernourishment or slum or the dole they want no get rich quick era of bogus prosperity which will end for they in sell apple on a street corner as happen after the bursting of the boom in 1929

 when you talk with our young man and our young woman you will find they want to work for themselves and for their family they consider that they have the right to work and they know that after the last war their father do not gain that right

 when you talk with our young man and woman you will find that with the opportunity for employment they want assurance against the evil of all major economic hazard assurance that will extend from the cradle to the grave and this great government can and must provide this assurance

 i have be tell that this be no time to speak of a well america after the war i be tell it be a grave error on my part

 i dissent

 and if the security of the individual citizen or the family should become a subject of national debate the country know where i stand

 i say this now to this 78th congress because it be wholly possible that freedom from want the right of employment the right of assurance against life 's hazard will loom very large as a task of america during the come two year

 i trust it will not be regard as an issue but rather as a task for all of we to study sympathetically to work out with a constant regard for the attainment of the objective with fairness to all and with injustice to none

 in this war of survival we must keep before our mind not only the evil thing we fight against but the good thing we be fight for we fight to retain a great past and we fight to gain a great future

 let we remember too that economic safety for the america of the future be threaten unless a great economic stability come to the rest of the world we can not make america an island in either a military or an economic sense hitlerism like any other form of crime or disease can grow from the evil seed of economic as well as military feudalism

 victory in this war be the first and great goal before we victory in the peace be the next that mean strive toward the enlargement of the security of man here and throughout the world and finally strive for the fourth freedom freedom from fear

 it be of little account for any of we to talk of essential human need of attain security if we run the risk of another world war in 10 or 20 or 50 year that be just plain common sense war grow in size in death and destruction and in the inevitability of engulf all nation in inverse ratio to the shrink size of the world as a result of the conquest of the air i shudder to think of what will happen to humanity include ourselves if this war end in an inconclusive peace and another war break out when the baby of today have grow to fight age

 every normal american pray that neither he nor his son nor his grandson will be compel to go through this horror again

 undoubtedly a few americans even now think that this nation can end this war comfortably and then climb back into an american hole and pull the hole in after they

 but we have learn that we can never dig a hole so deep that it would be safe against predatory animal we have also learn that if we do not pull the fang of the predatory animal of this world they will multiply and grow in strength and they will be at our throat again once more in a short generation

 most americans realize more clearly than ever before that modern war equipment in the hand of aggressor nation can bring danger overnight to our own national existence or to that of any other nation or island or continent

 it be clear to we that if germany and italy and japan or any one of they remain armed at the end of this war or be permit to rearm they will again and inevitably embark upon an ambitious career of world conquest they must be disarm and keep disarm and they must abandon the philosophy and the teaching of that philosophy which have bring so much suffering to the world

 after the first world war we try to achieve a formula for permanent peace base on a magnificent idealism we fail but by our failure we have learn that we can not maintain peace at this stage of human development by good intention alone

 today the united nations be the mighty military coalition in all history they represent an overwhelming majority of the population of the world bind together in solemn agreement that they themselves will not commit act of aggression or conquest against any of their neighbor the united nations can and must remain united for the maintenance of peace by prevent any attempt to rearm in germany in japan in italy or in any other nation which seek to violate the tenth commandment—"thou shalt not covet

 there be cynic there be skeptic who say it can not be do the american people and all the freedom love people of this earth be now demand that it must be do and the will of these people shall prevail

 the very philosophy of the axis power be base on a profound contempt for the human race if in the formation of our future policy we be guide by the same cynical contempt then we should be surrender to the philosophy of our enemy and our victory would turn to defeat

 the issue of this war be the basic issue between those who believe in mankind and those who do not the ancient issue between those who put their faith in the people and those who put their faith in dictator and tyrant there have always be those who do not believe in the people who attempt to block their forward movement across history to force they back to servility and suffering and silence

 the people have now gather their strength they be move forward in their might and power and no force no combination of force no trickery deceit or violence can stop they now they see before they the hope of the world a decent secure peaceful life for man everywhere

 i do not prophesy when this war will end

 but i do believe that this year of 1943 will give to the united nations a very substantial advance along the road that lead to berlin and rome and tokyo

 i tell you it be within the realm of possibility that this 78th congress may have the historic privilege of help greatly to save the world from future fear

 therefore let we all have confidence let we redouble our effort

 a tremendous costly long endure task in peace as well as in war be still ahead of we

 but as we face that continue task we may know that the state of this nation be good the heart of this nation be sound the spirit of this nation be strong the faith of this nation be eternal

my fellow americans
 i be speak tonight to the american people and in particular to those of our citizen who be coal miner
 tonight this country face a serious crisis we be engage in a war on the successful outcome of which will depend the whole future of our country
 this war have reach a new critical phase after the year that we have spend in preparation we have move into active and continue battle with our enemy we be pour into the worldwide conflict everything that we have our young man and the vast resource of our nation
 i have just return from a two week tour of inspection on which i see our man be train and our war material make my trip take i through twenty state i see thousand of worker on the production line make airplane and gun and ammunition
 everywhere i find great eagerness to get on with the war man and woman be work long hour at difficult job and live under difficult condition without complaint
 along thousand of mile of track i see countless acre of newly plough field the farmer of this country be plant the crop that be need to feed our armed force our civilian population and our allies those crop will be harvest
 on my trip i see hundred of thousand of soldier young man who be green recruit last autumn have mature into self assure and harden fight man they be in splendid physical condition they be master the superior weapon that we be pour out of our factory
 the american people have accomplish a miracle
 however all of our massed effort be none too great to meet the demand of this war we shall need everything that we have and everything that our allies have to defeat the nazis and the fascists in the come battle on the continent of europe and the japanese on the continent of asia and in the islands of the pacific
 this tremendous forward movement of the united states and the united nations can not be stop by our enemy
 and equally it must not be hamper by any one individual or by the leader of any one group here back home
 i want to make it clear that every american coal miner who have stop mining coal no matter how sincere his motive no matter how legitimate he may believe his grievance to be every idle miner directly and individually be obstruct our war effort we have not yet win this war we will win this war only as we produce and deliver our total american effort on the high sea and on the battlefront and that require unrelenting uninterrupted effort here on the home front
 a stopping of the coal supply even for a short time would involve a gamble with the life of american soldier and sailor and the future security of our whole people it would involve an unwarranted unnecessary and terribly dangerous gamble with our chance for victory
 therefore i say to all miner and to all americans everywhere at home and abroad the production of coal will not be stop
 tonight i be speak to the essential patriotism of the miner and to the patriotism of their wife and child and i be go to state the true fact of this case as simply and as plainly as i know how
 after the attack at pearl harbor the three great labor organization the american federation of labor the congress of industrial organizations and the railroad brotherhoods give the positive assurance that there would be no strike as long as the war last and the president of the united mine worker of america be a party to that assurance
 that pledge be applaud throughout the country it be a forcible mean of tell the world that we americans 135,000,000 of we be unite in our determination to fight this total war with our total will and our total power
 at the request of employer and of organize labor include the united mine workers the war labor board be set up for settle any dispute which could not be adjust through collective bargaining the war labor board be a tribunal on which worker employer and the general public be equally represent
 in the present coal crisis conciliation and mediation be try unsuccessfully
 in accordance with the law the case be then certify to the war labor board the agency create for this express purpose with the approval of organize labor the member of the board follow the usual practice which have prove successful in other dispute act promptly they undertake to get all the fact of this the case from both the miner and the operator
 the national officer of the united mine workers however decline to have anything to do with the fact finding of the war labor board the only excuse that they offer be that the war labor board be prejudiced
 the war labor board have be and be ready to give this the case a fair and impartial hearing and i have give my assurance that if any adjustment of wage be make by the board it will be make retroactive to april first but the national officer of the united mine workers refuse to participate in the hearing when ask to do so last monday
 on wednesday of this past week while the board be proceed with the case stoppage begin to occur in some mine on thursday morning i telegraph to the officer of the united mine workers ask that the miner continue mining coal on saturday morning however a general strike throughout the industry become effective on friday night
 the responsibility for the crisis that we now face rest squarely on these national officer of the united mine workers and not on the government of the united states but the consequence of this arbitrary action threaten all of we everywhere
 at ten o'clock yesterday morning saturday the government take over the mine i call upon the miner to return to work for their government the government need their service just as surely as it need the service of our soldier and sailor and marine and the service of the million who be turn out the munition of war
 you miner have son in the army and navy and marine corps you have son who at this very minute this split second may be fight in new guinea or in the aleutian islands or guadalcanal or tunisia or china or protect troop ship and supply against submarine on the high sea we have already receive telegram from some of our fight man overseas and i only wish they could tell you what they think of the stoppage of work in the coal mine
 some of your own son have come back from the fighting front wound a number of they for example be now here in an army hospital in washington several of they have be decorate by their government
 i could tell you of one from pennsylvania he be a coal miner before his induction and his father be a coal miner he be seriously wound by nazi machine gun bullet while he be on a bombing mission over europe in a flying fortress
 another boy from kentucky the son of a coal miner be wound when our troop first land in north africa six month ago
 there be still another from illinois he be a coal miner his father and two brother be coal miner he be seriously wound in tunisia while attempt to rescue two comrade whose jeep have be blow up by a nazi mine
 these man do not consider themselves hero they would probably be embarrassed if i mention their name over the air they be wound in the line of duty they know how essential it be to the ten of thousand hundred of thousand --and ultimately million of other young americans to get the good of arm and equipment into the hand of our fighting force and get they there quickly
 the father and mother of our fight man their brother and sister and friend and that include all of we be also in the line of duty the production line any failure in production may well result in costly defeat on the field of battle
 there can be no one among we no one faction powerful enough to interrupt the forward march of our people to victory
 you miner have ample reason to know that there be certain basic right for which this country stand and that those right be worth fight for and worth die for that be why you have send your son and brother from every mining town in the nation to join in the great struggle overseas that be why you have contribute so generously so willingly to the purchase of war bond and to the many fund for the relief of war victim in foreign land that be why since this war be start in 1939 you have increase the annual production of coal by almost two hundred million ton a year
 the toughness of your son in our armed force be not surprising they come of fine rugged stock man who work in the mine be not unaccustomed to hardship it have be the objective of this government to reduce that hardship to obtain for miner and for all who do the nation 's work a well standard of living
 i know only too well that the cost of living be trouble the miner family and trouble the family of million of other worker throughout the country as well
 a year ago it become evident to all of we that something have to be do about living cost your government determine not to let the cost of living continue to go up as it do in the first world war
 your government have be determine to maintain stability of both price and wage so that a dollar would buy so far as possible the same amount of the necessity of life and by necessity i mean just that not the luxury not the and fancy good that we have learn to do without in wartime
 so far we have not be able to keep the price of some necessity as low as we should have like to keep they that be true not only in coal town but in many other place
 wherever we find that price of essential have rise too high they will be bring down wherever we find that price ceiling be be violate the violator will be punish
 rent have be fix in most part of the country in many city they have be cut to below where they be before we enter the war clothing price have generally remain stable
 these two item make up more than a third of the total budget of the worker 's family
 as for food which today account for about another a third of the family expenditure on the average i want to repeat again your government will continue to take all necessary measure to eliminate unjustified and avoidable price increase and we be today now take measure to roll back the price of meat
 the war be go to go on coal will be mine no matter what any individual think about it the operation of our factory our power plant our railroad will not be stop our munition must move to our troop
 and so under these circumstance it be inconceivable that any patriotic miner can choose any course other than go back to work and mining coal
 the nation can not afford violence of any kind at the coal mine or in coal town i have place authority for the resumption of coal mining in the hand of a civilian the secretary of the interior if it become necessary to protect any miner who seek patriotically to go back and work then that miner must have and his family must have and will have complete and adequate protection if it become necessary to have troop at the mine mouth or in coal town for the protection of work miner and their family those troop will be do police duty for the sake of the nation as a whole and particularly for the sake of the fight man in the army the navy and the marines your son and mine who be fight our common enemy all over the world
 i understand the devotion of the coal miner to their union i know of the sacrifice they have make to build it up i believe now as i have all my life in the right of worker to join union and to protect their union i want to make it absolutely clear that this government be not go to do anything now to weaken those right in the coalfield
 every improvement in the condition of the coal miner of this country have have my hearty support and i do not mean to desert they now but i also do not mean to desert my obligation and responsibility as president of the united states and commander in chief of the army and navy
 the first necessity be the resumption of coal mining the term of the old contract will be follow by the secretary of the interior if an adjustment in wage result from a decision of the war labor board or from any new agreement between the operator and miner which be approve by the war labor board that adjustment will be make retroactive to april first
 in the message that i deliver to the congress four month ago i express my conviction that the spirit of this nation be good
 since then i have see our troop in the caribbean area in basis on the coast of our ally brazil and in north africa recently i have again see great number of our fellow countryman soldier and civilian from the atlantic seaboard to the mexican border and to the rocky mountains
 tonight in the fact of a crisis of serious proportion in the coal industry i say again that the spirit or this nation be good i know that the american people will not tolerate any threat offer to their government by anyone i believe the coal miner will not continue the strike against their the government i believe that the coal miner themselves as americans will not fail to heed the clear call to duty like all other good americans they will march shoulder to shoulder with their armed force to victory
 tomorrow the stars and stripes will fly over the coal mine and i hope that every miner will be at work under that flag

my fellow americans
 over a year and a half ago i say this to the congress the militarist in berlin and rome and tokyo start this war but the mass angered force of common humanity will finish it
 today that prophecy be in the process of be fulfil the mass angered force of common humanity be on the march they be go forward on the russian front in the vast pacific area and into europe converge upon their ultimate objective berlin and tokyo
 i think the first crack in the axis have come the criminal corrupt fascist regime in italy be go to piece
 the pirate philosophy of the fascists and the nazis can not stand adversity the military superiority of the united nations on sea and land and in the air have be apply in the right place and at the right time
 hitler refuse to send sufficient help to save mussolini in fact hitler 's troop in sicily steal the italians motor equipment leave italian soldier so strand that they have no choice but to surrender once again the germans betray their italian ally as they have do time and time again on the russian front and in the long retreat from egypt through libya and tripoli to the final surrender in tunisia
 and so mussolini come to the reluctant conclusion that the jig be up he could see the shadow of the long arm of justice
 but he and his fascist gang will be bring to book and punish for their crime against humanity no criminal will be allow to escape by the expedient of resignation
 so our term to italy be still the same as our term to germany and japan --"unconditional surrender
 we will have no truck with fascism in any way in any shape or manner we will permit no vestige of fascism to remain
 eventually italy will reconstitute herself it will be the people of italy who will do that choose their own government in accordance with the basic democratic principle of liberty and equality in the meantime the united nations will not follow the pattern set by mussolini and hitler and the japanese for the treatment of occupy country --the pattern of pillage and starvation
 we be already help the italian people in sicily with their cordial cooperation we be establish and maintain security and order we be dissolve the organization which have keep they under fascist tyranny we be provide they with the necessity of life until the time come when they can fully provide for themselves
 indeed the people in sicily today be rejoice in the fact that for the first time in year they be permit to enjoy the fruit of their own labor(s they can eat what they themselves grow instead of have it steal from they by the fascists and the nazis
 in every country conquer by the nazis and the fascists or the japanese militarist the people have be reduce to the status of slave or chattel
 it be our determination to restore these conquer people to the dignity of human being master of their own fate entitle to freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want and freedom from fear
 we have start to make good on that promise
 i be sorry if i step on the toe of those americans who play party politic at home call that kind of foreign policy crazy altruism and starry eyed dreaming
 meanwhile the war in sicily and italy go on it must go on and will go on until the italian people realize the futility of continue to fight in a lost cause a cause to which the people of italy never give their wholehearte approval and support
 it be a little over a year since we plan the north african campaign it be six month since we plan the sicilian campaign i confess that i be of an impatient disposition but i think that i understand and that most people understand the amount of time necessary to prepare for any major military or naval operation we can not just pick up the telephone and order a new campaign to start the next week
 for example behind the invasion force in of north africa the invasion force that go out of north africa be thousand of ship and plane guard the long perilous sea lane carry the man carry the equipment and the supply to the point of attack and behind all these be the railroad line and the highway here back home that carry the man and the munition to the port of embarkation there be the factory and the mine and the farm here back home that turn out the material there be the training camp here back home where the man learn how to perform the strange and difficult and dangerous task which be to meet they on the beach and in the desert and in the mountain
 all this have to be repeat first in north africa and then in in the attack on sicily here the factor in sicily the factor of air attack be add for we could use north africa as the base for soften up the landing place and line of defense in sicily and the line of supply in italy
 it be interesting for we to realize that every fly fortress that bomb harbor installation at for example naples bomb it from its base in north africa require 1,110 gallon of gasoline for each single mission and that this be the equal of about 375 a ration ticket enough gas to drive your car five time across this continent you will well understand your part in the war and what gasoline rationing mean if you multiply this by the gasoline need of thousand of plane and hundred of thousand of jeep and truck and tank that be now serve overseas
 i think that the personal convenience of the individual or the individual family back home here in the united states will appear somewhat less important when i tell you that the initial assault force on sicily involve 3,000 ship which carry 160,000 man americans british canadians and french together with 14,000 vehicle 600 tank and 1,800 gun and this initial force be follow every day and every night by thousand of reinforcement
 the meticulous care with which the operation in sicily be plan have pay dividend for our casualty in man in ship and material have be low in fact far below our estimate
 and all of we be proud of the superb skill and courage of the officer and man who have conduct and be conduct those this operation the tough resistance develop on the front of the british eighth army which include the canadians but that be no new experience for that magnificent fighting force which have make the germans pay a heavy price for each hour of delay in the final victory the american seventh army after a stormy landing on the expose beach of southern sicily sweep with record speed across the island into the capital at palermo for many of our troop this be their first battle experience but they have carry themselves like veteran
 and we must give credit for the coordination of the diverse force in the field and for the planning of the whole campaign to the wise and skillful leadership of general eisenhower admiral cunningham general alexander and sir marshal tedder have be tower of strength in handle the complex detail of naval and ground and air activity
 you have hear some people say that the british and the americans can never get along well together you have hear some people say that the army and the navy and the air forces can never get along well together that real cooperation between they be impossible tunisia and sicily have give the lie once and for all to these narrow minded prejudice
 the dauntless fighting spirit of the british people in this war have be express in the historic word and deed of winston churchill and the world know how the american people feel about he
 ahead of we be much big fight we and our allies will go into they as we go into sicily together and we shall carry on together
 today our production of ship be almost unbelievable this year we be produce over nineteen million ton of merchant shipping and next year our production will be over twenty one million ton and in addition to our shipment across the atlantic we must realize that in this war we be operate in the aleutians in the distant part of the southwest pacific in india and off the shore of south america
 for several month we have be lose few ship by sinking and we have be destroy more and more u boat we hope this will continue but we can not be sure we must not lower our guard for one single instant
 an example a tangible result of our great increase in merchant shipping which i think will be good news to civilian at home be that tonight we be able to terminate the rationing of coffee and we also expect that within a short time we shall get greatly increase allowance of sugar
 those few americans who grouse and complain about the inconvenience of life here in the united states should learn some lesson from the civilian population of our allies britain and china and russia and of all the land occupy by our common enemy enemy
 the heavy and most decisive fighting today be go on in russia i be glad that the british and we have be able to contribute somewhat to the great striking power of the russian army
 in 1941 1942 the russians be able to retire without breaking to move many of their war plant from western russia far into the interior to stand together with complete unanimity in the defense of their homeland
 the success of the russian army have show that it be dangerous to make prophecy about they a fact which have be forcibly bring home to that mystic master of strategic intuition herr hitler
 the short live german offensive launch early this month be a desperate attempt to bolster the morale of the german people the russians be not fool by this they go ahead with their own plan for attack plan which coordinate with the whole united nations offensive strategy
 the world have never see great devotion determination and self sacrifice than have be display by the russian people and their army under the leadership of marshal joseph stalin
 with a nation which in save itself be thereby help to save all the world from the nazi menace this country of our should always be glad to be a good neighbor and a sincere friend in the world of the future
 in the pacific we be push the japs around from the aleutians to new guinea there too we have take the initiative and we be not go to let go of it
 it become clear and clear that the attrition the whittle down process against the japanese be work the japs have lose more plane and more ship than they have be able to replace
 the continuous and energetic prosecution of the war of attrition will drive the japs back from their over extend line run from burma and siam and the straits settlement and siam through the netherlands indies to eastern new guinea and the solomon and we have good reason to believe that their shipping and their air power can not support such outpost
 our naval and land and air strength in the pacific be constantly grow and if the japanese be base their future plan for the pacific on a long period in which they will be permit to consolidate and exploit their conquered resource they have well start revise their plan now i give that to they merely as a helpful suggestion
 we be deliver plane and vital war supply for the heroic army of generalissimo chiang sai shek and we must do more at all cost
 our air supply line from india to china across enemy territory continue despite attempt japanese interference we have seize the initiative from the japanese in the air over burma and now we enjoy superiority we be bomb japanese communication supply dump and basis in china in indo china in and burma
 but we be still far from our main objective in the war against japan let we remember however how far we be a year ago from any of our objective in the european theatre we be push forward to occupation of position which in time will enable we to attack the japanese islands themselves from the north from the south from the east and from the west
 you have hear it say that while we be succeed greatly on the fighting front we be fail miserably on the home front i think this be another of those immaturity a false slogan easy to state but untrue in the essential fact
 for the long this war go on the clear it become that no one can draw a blue pencil down the middle of a page and call one side the fight front and the other side the home front for the two of they be inexorably tie together
 every combat division every naval task force every squadron of fight plane be dependent for its equipment and ammunition and fuel and food as indeed it be for its manpower dependent on the american people in civilian clothe in the office and in the factory and on the farm at home
 the same kind of careful planning that gain victory in north africa and sicily be require if we be to make victory an endure reality and do our share in build the kind of peaceful world that which will justify the sacrifice make in this war
 the united nations be substantially agree on the general objective for the post war world they be also agree that this be not the time to engage in an international discussion of all the term of peace and all the detail of the future let we win the war first we must not relax our pressure on the enemy by take time out to define every boundary and settle every political controversy in every part of the world the important thing the all important thing now be to get on with the war and to win it
 while concentrate on military victory we be not neglect the planning of the thing to come the freedom which we know will make for more decency and great justice throughout the world
 among many other thing we be today lay plan for the return to civilian life of our gallant man and woman in the armed service they must not be demobilize into an environment of inflation and unemployment to a place on a bread line or on a corner sell apple we must this time have plan ready instead of wait to do a hasty inefficient and ill consider job at the last moment
 i have assure our man in the armed force that the american people would not let they down when the war be win
 i hope that the congress will help in carry out this assurance for obviously the executive branch of the government can not do it alone may the congress do its duty in this regard the american people will insist on fulfil this american obligation to the man and woman in the armed force who be win this war for we
 of course the return soldier and sailor and marine be a part of the problem of demobilize the rest of the million of americans who have be work and live in a war economy since 1941 that large objective of reconvert wartime america to a peacetime basis be one for which your government be lay plan to be submit to the congress for action
 but the member of the armed force have be compel to make great economic sacrifice and every other kind of sacrifice than the rest of we and they be entitle to definite action to help take care of their special problem
 the least to which they be entitle it seem to i be something like this
 first 1 mustering out pay to every member of the armed force and merchant marine when he or she be honorably discharge mustering out pay large enough in each case to cover a reasonable period of time between his discharge and the finding of a new job
 secondly 2 in case no job be find after diligent search then unemployment insurance if the individual register with the united states employment service
 third 3 an opportunity for member of the armed service to get further education or trade training at the cost of the government
 fourth 4 allowance of credit to all member of the armed force under unemployment compensation and federal old age and survivor insurance for their period of service for these purpose they ought to should be treat as if they have continue their employment in private industry
 fifth 5 improve and liberalize provision for hospitalization for rehabilitation for and medical care of disabled member of the armed force and the merchant marine
 and finally 6 sufficient pension for disabled member of the armed force
 your government be draw up other serious constructive plan for certain immediate forward move they concern food manpower and other domestic problem that but they tie in with our armed force
 within a few week i shall speak with you again in regard to definite action to be take by the executive branch of the government together with and specific recommendation for new legislation by the congress
 all our calculation for the future however must be base on clear understanding of the problem involve and that can be gain only by straight thinking not guess work not or political manipulation
 i confess that i myself be sometimes bewilder by conflict statement that i see in the press one day i read an authoritative statement that we will shall win the war this year 1943 and the next day come another statement equally authoritative that the war will still be go on in 1949
 of course both extreme of optimism and pessimism be wrong
 the length of the war will depend upon the uninterrupted continuance of all out effort on the fight front and here at home and that the effort be all one
 the american soldier do not like the necessity of wage war and yet if he lay off for a one single instant he may lose his own life and sacrifice the life of his comrade
 by the same token a worker here at home may not like the driving wartime condition under which he have to work and or live and yet if he get complacent or indifferent and slack on his job he too may sacrifice the life of american soldier and contribute to the loss of an important battle
 the next time anyone say to you that this war be in the bag or say and it be all over but the shouting you should ask he these question
 be you work full time on your job
 be you grow all the food you can
 be you buy your limit of war bond
 be you loyally and cheerfully cooperate with your government in prevent inflation and profiteering and in make rationing work with fairness to all
 because if your answer be no then the war be go to last a lot long than you think
 the plan we make for the knock out of mussolini and his gang have largely succeed but we still have to knock out hitler and his gang and tojo and his gang no one of we pretend that this will be an easy matter
 we still have to defeat hitler and tojo on their own home ground but this will require a far great concentration of our national energy and our ingenuity and our skill
 it be not too much to say that we must pour into this war the entire strength and intelligence and will power of the united states we be a great nation a rich nation but we be not so great or so rich that we can afford to waste our substance or the life or our man by relax along the way
 we shall not settle for less than total victory that be the determination of every american on the fighting front that must be and will be the determination of every american here at home

my fellow americans
 once upon a time a few year ago there be a city in our middle west which be threaten by a destructive flood in the great river the water have rise to the top of the bank every man woman and child in that city be call upon to fill sand bag in order to defend their home against the rise water for many day and night destruction and death stare they in the face
 as a result of the grim determined community effort that city still stand those people keep the levee above the peak of the flood all of they join together in the desperate job that which have to be do business man worker farmer and doctor and preacher people of all race
 to i that town be a living symbol of what community cooperation can accomplish
 today in the same kind of community effort only very much large the united nations and their people have keep the levee of civilization high enough to prevent the flood of aggression and barbarism and wholesale murder from engulf we all the flood have be rage for four year at last we be begin to gain on it but the water have not yet recede enough for we to relax our sweating work with the sand bag in this war bond campaign we be fill bag and place they against the flood bag which be essential if we be to stand off the ugly torrent which be try to sweep we all away
 today it be announce that an armistice with italy have be conclude
 this be a great victory for the united nations but it be also a great victory for the italian people after year of war and suffering and degradation the italian people be at last come to the day of liberation from their real enemy the nazis
 but let we not delude ourselves that this armistice mean the end of the war in the mediterranean we still have to must drive the germans out of italy as we have drive they out of tunisia and sicily we must drive they out of france and all other captive country and we must strike they on their own soil from all direction
 our ultimate objective in this war continue to be berlin and tokyo
 i ask you to bear these objective constantly in mind and do not forget that we still have a long way to go before we attain attain they
 the great news that you have hear today from general eisenhower do not give you license to settle back in your rock chair and say well that do it we have get they them on the run now we can start the celebration
 the time for celebration be not yet and i have a suspicion that when this war do end we shall not be in a very celebrate mood a very celebrate frame of mind i think that our main emotion will be one of grim determination that this shall not happen again
 during the past week mr. churchill and i have be in constant conference with the leader of our combine fighting force we have be in constant communication with our fight allies russian and chinese who be prosecute the war with relentless determination and with conspicuous success on far distant front and mr. churchill he and i be here together in washington here at this crucial moment
 we have see the satisfactory fulfillment of plan that be make in casablanca last january and here in washington last may and lately we have make new well consider extensive plan for the future but throughout these conference we have never lose sight of the fact that this war will become big and tough rather than easy during the long month that be to come
 this war do not and must not stop for one single instant your our fight man know that those of they who be move forward through jungle against lurk japs those who be in land at this moment in barge move through the dawn up to strange enemy coast those who be dive their bomber down on the target at roof top level at this moment every one of these man know that this war be a full time job and that it will continue to be that until total victory be win
 and by the same token every responsible leader in all the united nations know that the fighting go on twenty four hour a day seven day a week and that any day lose may have to be pay for in term of month add to the duration of the war
 every campaign every single operation in all the campaign that we plan and carry through must be figure in term of staggering material cost we can not afford to be niggardly with any of our resource for we shall need all of they to do the job that we have put our undertaken shoulder to
 your fellow americans have give a magnificent account of themselves on the battlefield and on the ocean and in the sky all over the world
 now it be up to you to prove to they that you be contribute your share and more than your share it be not sufficient to simply to put money into war bonds money which we would normally save we must put money into war bonds money which we would not normally save only then have we do everything that good conscience demand so it be up to you up to you the americans in the american home the very home which our son and daughter be work and fight and die to preserve
 i know i speak for every man and woman throughout the americas when i say that we americans will not be satisfied to send our troop into the fire of the enemy with equipment inferior in any way nor will we be satisfied to send our troop with equipment only equal to that of the enemy we be determined to provide our troop with overpowering superiority superiority of quantity quality and quality quantity in any and every category of arm and armament that they may conceivably need
 and where do this our dominate power come from why it can come only from you the money you lend and the money you give in taxis buy that death dealing and at the same time life save power that we need for victory this be an expensive war expensive in money you can help it you can help to keep it at a minimum cost in life
 the american people will never stop to reckon the cost of redeem civilization they know there never can be any economic justification for fail to save freedom
 and we can be sure that our enemy will watch this drive with the keen interest they know that success in this undertaking will shorten the war they know that the more money the american people lend to their government the more powerful and relentless will be the american force in the field they know that only a united and determined america could possibly produce on a voluntary basis so huge large a sum of money as fifteen billion dollar
 the overwhelming success of the second war loan drive last april show that the people of this democracy stand firm behind their troop
 this the third war loan which we be start tonight will also succeed --because the american people will not permit it to fail
 i can not tell you how much to invest in war bonds during this third war loan drive no one can tell you it be for you to decide under the guidance of your own conscience
 i will say this however because the nation 's need be great than ever before our sacrifice too must be great than they have ever be before
 nobody know when total victory will come but we do know that the hard we fight now the more might and power we direct at the enemy now the short the war will be and the small the sum total of sacrifice
 success of the third war loan will be the symbol that america do not propose to rest on its arm that we know the tough bitter job ahead and will not stop until we have finish it
 now it be your turn
 every dollar that you invest in the third war loan be your personal message of defiance to our common enemy to the ruthless savage militarist of germany and japan and it be your personal message of faith and good cheer to our allies and to all the man at the front god bless they

my friend
 i have recently just return from extensive journeying in the region of the mediterranean and as far as the border of russia i have confer with the leader of britain and russia and china on military matter of the present --especially on plan for stepping up our successful attack on our enemy as quickly as possible and from many different point of the compass
 on this christmas eve there be over ten million man in the armed force of the united states alone one year ago 1,700,000 be serve overseas today this figure have be more than double to 3,800,000 on duty overseas by next july first that number overseas will rise to over 5,000,000 man and woman
 that this be truly a world war be demonstrate to i when arrangement be be make with our overseas broadcasting agency for the time to speak today to our soldier and sailor and marine and merchant seaman in every part of the world in fix the time for this the broadcast we take into consideration that at this moment here in the united states and in the caribbean and on the northeast coast of south america it be afternoon in alaska and in hawaii and the mid pacific it be still morning in iceland in great britain in north africa in italy and the middle east it be now evening
 in the southwest pacific in australia in china and burma and india it be already christmas day so we can correctly say that at this moment in those far eastern part where americans be fight today be tomorrow
 but everywhere throughout the world through(out this war that which cover the world there be a special spirit that which have warm our heart since our early childhood a spirit that which bring we close to our home our family our friend and neighbor the christmas spirit of peace on earth goodwill toward man it be an unquenchable spirit
 during the past year of international gangsterism and brutal aggression in europe and in asia our christmas celebration have be darken with apprehension for the future we have say merry christmas a happy new year but we have know in our heart that the cloud which have hang over our world have prevent we from say it with full sincerity and conviction
 and but even this year we still have much to face in the way of further suffering and sacrifice and personal tragedy our man who have be through the fierce battle in the solomon and the gilberts and tunisia and italy know from their own experience and knowledge of modern war that many big and costly battle be still to be fight
 but on christmas eve this year i can say to you that at last we may look forward into the future with real substantial confidence that however great the cost peace on earth good will toward man can be and will be realize and ensure this year i can say that last year i could not do more than express a hope today i express a certainty though the cost may be high and the time may be long
 within the past year within the past few week history have be make and it be far well history for the whole human race than any that we have know or even dare to hope for in these tragic time through which we pass
 a great beginning be make in the moscow conference last in october by mr. molotov mr. eden and our own mr. hull there and then the way be pave for the later meeting
 at cairo and teheran we devote ourselves not only to military matter we devote ourselves also to consideration of the future to plan for the kind of world which alone can justify all the sacrifice of this war
 of course as you all know mr. churchill and i have happily meet many time before and we know and understand each other very well indeed mr. churchill have become know and belove by many million of americans and the heartfelt prayer of all of we have be with this great citizen of the world in his recent serious illness
 the cairo and teheran conference however give i my first opportunity to meet the generalissimo chiang kai shek and marshal stalin and to sit down at the table with these unconquerable man and talk with they face to face we have plan to talk to each other across the table at cairo and teheran but we soon find that we be all on the same side of the table we come to the conference with faith in each other but we need the personal contact and now we have supplement faith with definite knowledge
 it be well worth travel thousand of mile over land and sea to bring about this personal meeting and to gain the heartening assurance that we be absolutely agree with one another on all the major objective and on the military mean of obtain they
 at cairo prime minister churchill and i spend four day with the generalissimo chiang kai shek it be the first time that we have have an opportunity to go over the complex situation in the far east with he personally we be able not only to settle upon definite military strategy but also to discuss certain long range principle which we believe can assure peace in the far east for many generation to come
 those principle be as simple as they be fundamental they involve the restoration of steal property to its rightful owner and the recognition of the right of million of people in the far east to build up their own form of self government without molestation essential to all peace and security in the pacific and in the rest of the world be the permanent elimination of the empire of japan as a potential force of aggression never again must our soldier and sailor and marine and other soldier sailor and marine be compel to fight from island to island as they be fight so gallantly and so successfully today
 increasingly powerful force be now hammer at the japanese at many point over an enormous arc which curve down through the pacific from the aleutians to the jungles of burma our own army and navy our air forces the australians and new zealanders the dutch and the british land air and sea force be all form a band of steel which be slowly but surely close in on japan
 and on the mainland of asia under the generalissimo 's leadership the chinese ground and air force augment by american air force be play a vital part in start the drive which will push the invader into the sea
 follow out the military decision at cairo general marshall have just fly around the world and have have conference with general macarthur and admiral nimitz conference which will spell plenty of bad news for the japs in the not too far distant future
 i meet in the generalissimo a man of great vision and great courage and a remarkably keen understanding of the problem of today and tomorrow we discuss all the manifold military plan for strike at japan with decisive force from many direction and i believe i can say that he return to chungking with the positive assurance of total victory over our common enemy today we and the republic of china be close together than ever before in deep friendship and in unity of purpose
 after the cairo conference mr. churchill and i go by airplane to teheran there we meet with marshal stalin we talk with complete frankness on every conceivable subject connect with the winning of the war and the establishment of a durable peace after the war
 within three day of intense and consistently amicable discussion we agree on every point concern with the launching of a gigantic attack upon germany
 the russian army will continue its stern offensive on germany 's eastern front the ally army in italy and africa will bring relentless pressure on germany from the south and now the encirclement will be complete as great american and british force attack from other point of the compass
 the commander select to lead the combined attack from these other point be general dwight d. eisenhower his performance in africa in sicily and in italy have be brilliant he know by practical and successful experience the way to coordinate air sea and land power all of these will be under his control lieutenant general carl d. spaatz will command the entire american strategic bombing force operate against germany
 general eisenhower give up his command in the mediterranean to a british officer whose name be be announce by mr. churchill we now pledge that new commander that our powerful ground sea and air force in the vital mediterranean area will stand by his side until every objective in that bitter theatre be attain
 both of these new commanders will have american and british subordinate commander whose name will be announce to the world in a few day
 during the last two day in at teheran marshal stalin mr. churchill and i look ahead ahead to the day and month and year that which will follow germany 's defeat we be unite in determination that germany must be strip of her military might and be give no opportunity within the foreseeable future to regain that might
 the united nations have no intention to enslave the german people we wish they to have a normal chance to develop in peace as useful and respectable member of the european family but we most certainly emphasize that word respectable for we intend to rid they once and for all of nazism and prussian militarism and the fantastic and disastrous notion that they constitute the master race
 we do discuss international relationship from the point of view of big broad objective rather than detail but on the basis of what we do discuss i can say even today that i do not think any insoluble difference will arise among russia great britain and the united states
 in these conference we be concern with basic principle principle which involve the security and the welfare and the standard of living or human being in country large and small
 to use an american and somewhat ungrammatical colloquialism i may say that i get along fine with marshal stalin he be a man who combine a tremendous relentless determination with a stalwart good humor i believe he be truly representative of the heart and soul of russia and i believe that we be go to get along very well with he and the russian people very well indeed
 britain russia china and the united states and their allies represent more than three quarter of the total population of the earth as long as these four nation with great military power stick together in determination to keep the peace there will be no possibility of an aggressor nation arise to start another world war
 but those four power must be unite with and cooperate with all the freedom love people of europe and asia and africa and the americas the right of every nation large or small must be respect and guard as jealously as be the right of every individual within our own republic
 the doctrine that the strong shall dominate the weak be the doctrine of our enemy and we reject it
 but at the same time we be agree that if force be necessary to keep international peace international force will be apply for as long as it may be necessary
 it have be our steady policy and it be certainly a common sense policy that the right of each nation to freedom must be measure by the willingness of that nation to fight for freedom and today we salute our unseen allies in occupy country the underground resistance group and the army of liberation they will provide potent force against our enemy when the day of the counter invasion come
 through the development of science the world have become so much small that we have have to discard the geographical yardstick of the past for instance through our early history the atlantic and pacific oceans be believe to be wall of safety for the united states time and distance make it physically possible for example for we and for the other american republics to obtain and maintain our independence against infinitely strong power until recently very few people even military expert think that the day would ever come when we might have to defend our pacific coast against japanese threat of invasion
 at the outbreak of the first world war relatively few people think that our ship and shipping would be menace by german submarine on the high sea or that the german militarist would ever attempt to dominate any nation outside of central europe
 after the armistice in 1918 we think and hope that the militaristic philosophy of germany have be crush and be full of the milk of human kindness we spend the next twenty fifteen year disarm while the germans whine so pathetically that the other nation permit they and even help they to rearm
 for too many year we live on pious hope that aggressor and warlike nation would learn and understand and carry out the doctrine of purely voluntary peace
 the well intentione but ill fate experiment of former year do not work it be my hope that we will not try they again no that be put it too weakly it be my intention to do all that i humanly can as president and commander in chief to see to it that these tragic mistake shall not be make again
 there have always be cheerful idiot in this country who believe that there would be no more war for we if everybody in america would only return into their home and lock their front door behind they assume that their motive be of the high event have show how unwilling they be to face the fact
 the overwhelming majority of all the people in the world want peace most of they be fight for the attainment of peace not just a truce not just an armistice but peace that be as strongly enforce and as durable as mortal man can make it if we be willing to fight for peace now be it not good logic that we should use force if necessary in the future to keep the peace
 i believe and i think i can say that the other three great nation who be fight so magnificently to gain peace be in complete agreement that we must be prepared to keep the peace by force if the people of germany and japan be make to realize thoroughly that the world be not go to let they break out again it be possible and i hope probable that they will abandon the philosophy of aggression the belief that they can gain the whole world even at the risk of lose their own soul
 i shall have more to say about the cairo and teheran conference when i make my report to the congress in about two week time and on that occasion i shall also have a great deal to say about certain condition here at home
 but today i wish to say that in all my travel at home and abroad it be the sight of our soldier and sailor and their magnificent achievement which have give i the great inspiration and the great encouragement for the future
 to the member of our armed force to their wife mother and father i want to affirm the great faith and confidence that we have in general marshall and in admiral king who direct all of our armed might throughout the world upon they fall the great responsibility of plan the strategy of determine when and where and when we shall fight both of these man have already gain high place in american history place which will record in that history many evidence of their military genius that can not be publish today
 some of our man overseas be now spend their third christmas far from home to they and to all other overseas or soon to go overseas i can give assurance that it be the purpose of their government to win this war and to bring they home at the early possible time date
 and we here in the united states have well be sure that when our soldier and sailor do come home they will find an america in which they be give full opportunity for education and rehabilitation social security and employment and business enterprise under the free american system and that they will find a government which by their vote as american citizen they have have a full share in elect
 the american people have have every reason to know that this be a tough and destructive war on my trip abroad i talk with many military man who have face our enemy in the field these hard head realist testify to the strength and skill and resourcefulness of the enemy general and man whom we must beat before final victory be win the war be now reach the stage where we shall all have to look forward to large casualty list dead wound and missing
 war entail just that there be no easy road to victory and the end be not yet in sight
 i have be back only for a week it be fair that i should tell you my impression i think i see a tendency in some of our people here to assume a quick ending of the war that we have already gain the victory and perhaps as a result of this false reasoning i think i discern an effort to resume or even encourage an outbreak of partisan thinking and talk i hope i be wrong for surely our first and most foremost task be all concerned with win the war and win a just peace that will last for generation
 the massive offensive which be in the making both in europe and the far east will require every ounce of energy and fortitude that we and our allies can summon on the fight front and in all the workshop at home as i have say before you can not order up a great attack on a monday and demand that it be deliver on saturday
 less than a month ago i fly in a big army transport plane over the little town of bethlehem in palestine
 tonight on christmas eve all man and woman everywhere who love christmas be think of that ancient town and of the star of faith that shine there more than nineteen century ago
 american boy be fight today in snow cover mountain in malarial jungle and on blaze desert they be fight on the far stretch of the sea and above the cloud and fight for the thing for which they struggle i think it be well symbolize by the message that come out of bethlehem
 on behalf of the american people your own people i send this christmas message to you to you who be in our armed force
 in our heart be prayer for you and for all your comrade in arm who fight to rid the world of evil
 we ask god 's blessing upon you upon your father and mother and wife and child all your love one at home
 we ask that the comfort of god 's grace shall be grant to those who be sick and wounded and to those who be prisoner of war in the hand of the enemy wait for the day when they will again be free
 and we ask that god receive and cherish those who have give their life and that he keep they in honor and in the grateful memory of their countryman forever
 god bless all of you who fight our battle on this christmas eve
 god bless we all god keep we strong in our faith that we fight for a well day for human kind here and everywhere

today i send my annual message to the congress as require by the constitution it have be my custom to deliver these annual message in person and they have be broadcast to the nation i intend to follow this same custom this year

 but like a great many other people i have have the flu and although i be practically recovered my doctor simply would not permit i to leave the white house to go up to the capitol

 only a few of the newspaper of the united states can print the message in full and i be anxious that the american people be give an opportunity to hear what i have recommend to the congress for this very fateful year in our history and the reason for those recommendation here be what i say

 this nation in the past two year have become an active partner in the world 's great war against human slavery

 we have join with like minded people in order to defend ourselves in a world that have be gravely threaten with gangster rule

 but i do not think that any of we americans can be content with mere survival sacrifice that we and our allies be make impose upon we all a sacred obligation to see to it that out of this war we and our child will gain something well than mere survival

 we be unite in determination that this war shall not be follow by another interim which lead to new disaster that we shall not repeat the tragic error of ostrich isolationism

 when mr. hull go to moscow in october when i go to cairo and teheran in november we know that we be in agreement with our allies in our common determination to fight and win this war there be many vital question concern the future peace and they be discuss in an atmosphere of complete candor and harmony

 in the last war such discussion such meeting do not even begin until the shooting have stop and the delegate begin to assemble at the peace table there have be no previous opportunity for man to man discussion which lead to meeting of mind and the result be a peace which be not a peace

 and right here i want to address a word or two to some suspicious soul who be fearful that mr. hull or i have make commitment for the future which might pledge this nation to secret treaty or to enact the role of a world santa claus

 of course we make some commitment we most certainly commit ourselves to very large and very specific military plan which require the use of all ally force to bring about the defeat of our enemy at the early possible time

 but there be no secret treaty or political or financial commitment

 the one supreme objective for the future which we discuss for each nation individually and for all the united nations can be sum up in one word security

 and that mean not only physical security which provide safety from attack by aggressor it mean also economic security social security moral security in a family of nation

 in the plain down to earth talk that i have with the generalissimo and marshal stalin and prime minister churchill it be abundantly clear that they be all most deeply interested in the resumption of peaceful progress by their own people progress toward a well life

 all our allies have learn by experience bitter experience that real development will not be possible if they be to be divert from their purpose by repeat war or even threat of war

 the good interest of each nation large and small demand that all freedom love nation shall join together in a just and durable system of peace in the present world situation evidence by the action of germany and italy and japan unquestione military control over the disturber of the peace be as necessary among nation as it be among citizen in any community and an equally basic essential to peace permanent peace be a decent standard of live for all individual man and woman and child in all nation freedom from fear be eternally link with freedom from want

 there be people who burrow burrow through the nation like unseee mole and attempt to spread the suspicion that if other nation be encourage to raise their standard of living our own american standard of living must of necessity be depressed

 the fact be the very contrary it have be show time and again that if the standard of living of any country go up so do its purchasing power and that such a rise encourage a well standard of living in neighboring country with whom it trade that be just plain common sense and be the kind of plain common sense that provide the basis for our discussion at moscow and cairo and teheran

 return from my journeying i must confess to a sense of be let down when i find many evidence of faulty perspective here in washington the faulty perspective consist in over emphasize less problem and thereby under emphasize the first and great problem

 the overwhelming majority of our people have meet the demand of this war with magnificent courage and a great deal of understanding they have accept inconvenience they have accept hardship they have accept tragic sacrifice

 however while the majority go on about its great work without complaint we all know that a noisy minority maintain an uproar an uproar of demand for special favor for special group there be pest who swarm through the lobby of the congress and the cocktail bar of washington represent these special group as oppose to the basic interest of the nation as a whole they have come to look upon the war primarily as a chance to make profit for themselves at the expense of their neighbor profit in money or profit in term of political or social preferment

 such selfish agitation can be and be highly dangerous in wartime it create confusion it damage morale it hamper our national effort it prolong the war

 in this war we have be compel to learn how interdependent upon each other be all group and section of the whole population of america

 increase food cost for example will bring new demand for wage increase from all war worker which will in turn raise all price of all thing include those thing which the farmer themselves have to buy increase wage or price will each in turn produce the same result they all have a particularly disastrous result on all fix income group

 and i hope you will remember that all of we in this government include myself represent the fix income group just as much as we represent business owner or worker or farmer this group of fix income people include teacher and clergy and policeman and fireman and widow and minor who be on fix income wife and dependent of our soldier and sailor and old age pensioner they and their family add up to more than a quarter of our 130 million people they have few or no high pressure representative at the capitol and in a period of gross inflation they would be the bad sufferer let we give they an occasional thought

 if ever there be a time to subordinate individual or group selfishness for the national good that time be now disunity at home and bickering self seek partisanship stoppage of work inflation business as usual politic as usual luxury as usual and sometimes a failure to tell the whole truth these be the influence which can undermine the morale of the brave man ready to die at the front for we here

 those who be do most of the complaining i do not think that they be deliberately strive to sabotage the national war effort they be labor under the delusion that the time be past when we must make prodigious sacrifice that the war be already win and we can begin to slacken off but the dangerous folly of that point of view can be measure by the distance that separate our troop from their ultimate objective in berlin and tokyo and by the sum of all the peril that lie along the way

 over confidence and complacency be among our deadly of all enemy

 and that attitude on the part of anyone government or management or labor can lengthen this war it can kill american boy

 let we remember the lesson of 1918 in the summer of that year the tide turn in favor of the allies but this government do not relax nor do the american people in fact our nation ’s effort be step up in august 1918 the draft age limit be broaden from 21 to 31 all the way to 18 to 45 the president call for force to the utmost and his call be heed and in november only three month later germany surrender

 that be the way to fight and win a war all out and not with half an eye on the battlefront abroad and the other eye and a half on personal selfish or political interest here at home

 therefore in order to concentrate all of our energy all of our resource on win this war and to maintain a fair and stable economy at home i recommend that the congress adopt

 first a realistic and simplified tax law which will tax all unreasonable profit both individual and corporate and reduce the ultimate cost of the war to our son and our daughter the tax bill now under consideration by the congress do not begin to meet this test

 secondly a continuation of the law for the renegotiation of war contract which will prevent exorbitant profit and assure fair price to the government for two long year i have plead with the congress to take undue profit out of war

 third a cost of food law which will enable the government to place a reasonable floor under the price the farmer may expect for his production and to place a ceiling on the price the consumer will have to pay for the necessary food he buy this should apply as i have intimate to necessity only and this will require public fund to carry it out it will cost in appropriation about one percent of the present annual cost of the war

 fourth an early re enactment of the stabilization statute of october 1942 this expire this year june 30 1944 and if it be not extend well in advance the country might just as well expect price chaos by summertime

 we can not have stabilization by wishful thinking we must take positive action to maintain the integrity of the american dollar

 and fifth a national service law which for the duration of the war will prevent strike and with certain appropriate exception will make available for war production or for any other essential service every able bodied adult in this whole nation

 these five measure together form a just and equitable whole i would not recommend a national service law unless the other law be pass to keep down the cost of living to share equitably the burden of taxation to hold the stabilization line and to prevent undue profit

 the federal government already have the basic power to draft capital and property of all kind for war purpose on a basis of just compensation

 and as you know i have for three year hesitate to recommend a national service act today however with all the experience we have behind we and with we i be convinced of its necessity although i believe that we and our allies can win the war without such a measure i be certain that nothing less than total mobilization of all our resource of manpower and capital will guarantee an early victory and reduce the toll of suffering and sorrow and blood

 as some of my adviser write i the other day

 when the very life of the nation be in peril the responsibility for service be common to all man and woman in such a time there can be no discrimination between the man and woman who be assign by the government to its defense at the battlefront and the man and woman assign to produce the vital material that be essential to successful military operation a prompt enactment of a national service law would be merely an expression of the universality of this american responsibility

 i believe the country will agree that those statement be the solemn truth

 national service be the most democratic way to wage a war like selective service for the armed force it rest on the obligation of each citizen to serve his nation to his utmost where he be well qualified

 it do not mean reduction in wage it do not mean loss of retirement and seniority right and benefit it do not mean that any substantial number of war worker will be disturb in their present job let this fact be wholly clear

 there be million of american man and woman who be not in this war at all that be not because they do not want to be in it but they want to know where they can well do their share national service provide that direction

 i know that all civilian war worker will be glad to be able to say many year hence to their grandchild yes i too be in service in the great war i be on duty in an airplane factory and i help to make hundred of fight plane the government tell i that in do that i be perform my most useful work in the service of my country

 it be argue that we have pass the stage in the war where national service be necessary but our soldier and sailor know that this be not true we be go forward on a long rough road and in all journey the last mile be the hard and it be for that final effort for the total defeat of our enemy that we must mobilize our total resource the national war program call for the employment of more people in 1944 than in 1943

 and it be my conviction that the american people will welcome this win the war measure which be base on the eternally just principle of fair for one fair for all

 it will give our people at home the assurance that they be stand four square behind our soldier and sailor and it will give our enemy demoralize assurance that we mean business that we 130 million americans be on the march to rome and berlin and tokyo

 i hope that the congress will recognize that although this be a political year national service be an issue which transcend politic great power must be use for great purpose

 as to the machinery for this measure the congress itself should determine its nature as long as it be wholly non partisan in its makeup

 several allege reason have prevent the enactment of legislation which would preserve for our soldier and sailor and marine the fundamental prerogative of citizenship in other word the right to vote no amount of legalistic argument can becloud this issue in the eye of these ten million american citizen surely the signer of the constitution do not intend a document which even in wartime would be construe to take away the franchise of any of those who be fight to preserve the constitution itself

 our soldier and sailor and marine know that the overwhelming majority of they will be deprive of the opportunity to vote if the voting machinery be leave exclusively to the state under exist state law and that there be no likelihood of these law be change in time to enable they to vote at the next election the army and navy have report that it will be impossible effectively to administer 48 different soldier vote law it be the duty of the congress to remove this unjustifiable discrimination against the man and woman in our armed force and to do it just as quickly as possible

 it be our duty now to begin to lay the plan and determine the strategy more than the winning of the war it be time to begin plan and determine the strategy for win a last peace and the establishment of an american standard of living high than ever know before

 this republic have its beginning and grow to its present strength under the protection of certain inalienable political right among they the right of free speech free press free worship trial by jury freedom from unreasonable search and seizure they be our right to life and liberty

 we have come to a clear realization of the fact however that true individual freedom can not exist without economic security and independence necessitous man be not free man people who be hungry people who be out of a job be the stuff of which dictatorship be make

 in our day these economic truth have become accept as self evident we have accept so to speak a second bill of rights under which a new basis of security and prosperity can be establish for all regardless of station or race or creed

 among these be

 the right to a useful and remunerative job in the industry or shop or farm or mine of the nation

 the right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation

 the right of farmer to raise and sell their product at a return which will give they and their family a decent living

 the right of every business man large and small to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopoly at home or abroad

 the right of every family to a decent home

 the right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health

 the right to adequate protection from the economic fear of old age and sickness and accident and unemployment

 and finally the right to a good education

 all of these right spell security and after this war be win we must be prepare to move forward in the implementation of these right to new goal of human happiness and well being

 america 's own rightful place in the world depend in large part upon how fully these and similar right have be carry into practice for all our citizen for unless there be security here at home there can not be last peace in the world

 one of the great american industrialist of our day a man who have render yeoman service to his country in this crisis recently emphasize the grave danger of rightist reaction in this nation any clear think business man share that concern indeed if such reaction should develop if history be to repeat itself and we be to return to the so call normalcy of the 1920 then it be certain that even though we shall have conquer our enemy on the battlefield abroad we shall have yield to the spirit of fascism here at home

 i ask the congress to explore the mean for implement this economic bill of right for it be definitely the responsibility of the congress so to do and the country know it many of these problem be already before committee of the congress in the form of propose legislation i shall from time to time communicate with the congress with respect to these and further proposal in the event that no adequate program of progress be evolve i be certain that the nation will be conscious of the fact

 our fight man abroad and their family at home expect such a program and have the right to insist on it it be to their demand that this government should pay heed rather than to the whine demand of selfish pressure group who seek to feather their nest while young americans be die

 i have often say that there be no two front for america in this war there be only one front there be one line of unity that extend from the heart of people at home to the man of our attack force in our farth outpost when we speak of our total effort we speak of the factory and the field and the mine as well as the battlefield we speak of the soldier and the civilian the citizen and his government

 each and every one of they have a solemn obligation under god to serve this nation in its most critical hour to keep this nation great to make this nation great in a well world

my friend
 yesterday on june fourth 1944 rome fall to american and allied troop the first of the axis capital be now in our hand one up and two to go
 it be perhaps significant that the first of these capital to fall should have the long history of all of they the story of rome go back to the time of the foundation of our civilization we can still see there monument of the time when rome and the romans control the whole of the then know world that too be significant for the united nations be determined that in the future no one city and no one race will be able to control the whole of the world
 in addition to the monument of the old time we also see in rome the great symbol of christianity which have reach into almost every part of the world there be other shrine and other church in many place but the church and shrine of rome be visible symbol of the faith and determination of the early saint and martyr that christianity should live and become universal and tonight now it will be a source of deep satisfaction that the freedom of the pope and the of vatican city be assure by the army of the united nations
 it be also significant that rome have be liberate by the armed force of many nation the american and british army who bear the chief burden of battle find at their side our own north american neighbor the gallant canadians the fight new zealanders from the far south pacific the courageous french and the french moroccans the south africans the poles and the east indians all of they fight with we on the bloody approach to the city of rome
 the italians too forswear a partnership in the axis which they never desire have send their troop to join we in our battle against the german trespasser on their soil
 the prospect of the liberation of rome mean enough to hitler and his general to induce they to fight desperately at great cost of man and material and with great sacrifice to their crumble eastern line and to their western front no thank be due to they if rome be spare the devastation which the germans wreak on naples and other italian city the allied generals maneuver so skillfully that the nazis could only have stay long enough to damage rome at the risk of lose their army
 but rome be of course more than a military objective
 ever since before the day of the caesars rome have stand as a symbol of authority rome be the republic rome be the empire rome be and be in a sense the catholic church and rome be the capital of a united italy later unfortunately a quarter of a century ago rome become the seat of fascism one of the three capital of the axis
 for this a quarter century the italian people be enslave they be and degrade by the rule of mussolini from rome they will mark its liberation with deep emotion in the north of italy the people be still dominate and threaten by the nazi overlord and their fascist puppet somehow in the back of my head i still remember a name mussolini
 our victory come at an excellent time while our allied force be poise for another strike at western europe and while the army of other nazi soldier nervously await our assault and in the meantime our gallant russian allies continue to make their power feel more and more
 from a strictly military standpoint we have long ago accomplish certain of the main objective of our italian campaign the control of the island the major island the control of the sea lane of the mediterranean to shorten our combat and supply line and the capture of the airport such as the great airport of foggia south of rome from which we have strike tell blow on the continent the whole of the continent all the way up to the russian front
 it would be unwise to inflate in our own mind the military importance of the capture of rome we shall have to push through a long period of great effort and fiercer fighting before we get into germany itself the germans have retreat thousand of mile all the way from the gate of cairo through libya and tunisia and sicily and southern italy they have suffer heavy loss but not great enough yet to cause collapse
 germany have not yet be drive to surrender germany have not yet be drive to the point where she will be unable to recommence world conquest a generation hence
 therefore the victory still lie some distance ahead that distance will be cover in due time have no fear of that but it will be tough and it will be costly as i have tell you many many time
 in italy the people have live so long under the corrupt rule of mussolini that in spite of the tinsel at the top you have see the picture of he their economic condition have grow steadily bad our troop have find starvation malnutrition disease a deteriorate education and lower public health all by product of the fascist misrule
 the task of the allies in occupation have be stupendous we have have to start at the very bottom assist local government to reform on democratic line we have have to give they bread to replace that which be steal out of their mouth by the germans we have have to make it possible for the italians to raise and use their own local crop we have to help they cleanse their school of fascist trapping
 i think the american people as a whole approve the salvage of these human being who be only now learn to walk in a new atmosphere of freedom
 some of we may let our thought run to the financial cost of it essentially it be what we can call a form of relief and at the same time we hope that this relief will be an investment for the future an investment that will pay dividend by eliminate fascism by and end any italian desire to start another war of aggression in the future and that mean that they be dividend which justify such an investment because they be additional support for world peace
 the italian people be capable of self government we do not lose sight of their virtue as a peace love nation
 we remember the many century in which the italians be leader in the art and science enrich the life of all mankind
 we remember the great son of the italian people galileo and marconi michelangelo and dante and incidentally that fearless discoverer who typify the courage of italy christopher columbus
 italy can not grow in stature by seek to build up a great militaristic empire italians have be overcrowd within their own territory but they do not need to try to conquer the land of other people in order to find the breath of life other people may not want to be conquer
 in the past italians have come by the million into to the united states they have be welcome they have prosper they have become good citizen community and governmental leader they be not italian americans they be americans americans of italian descent
 the italians have go in great number to the other americas brazil and the argentine for example hundred and hundred of thousand of they they have go and to many other nation in every continent of the world give of their industry and their talent and achieve success and the comfort of good living and good citizenship
 italy should go on as a great mother nation contribute to the culture and the progress and the goodwill of all mankind and develop her special talent in the art and craft and science and preserve her historic and cultural heritage for the benefit of all people
 we want and expect the help of the future italy toward last peace all the other nation oppose to fascism and nazism ought to should help to give italy a chance
 the germans after year of domination in rome leave the people in the eternal city on the verge of starvation we and the british will do and be do everything we can to bring they relief anticipate the fall of rome we make preparation to ship food supply to the city but of course it should be bear in mind that the need be so great and the transportation requirement of our army so heavy that improvement must be gradual but we have already begin to save the life of the man woman and child of rome
 this i think be an example of the efficiency of your machinery of war the magnificent ability and energy of the american people in grow the crop build the merchant ship in make and collect the cargo in get the supply over thousand of mile of water and think ahead to meet emergency all this spell i think an amazing efficiency on the part of our armed force all the various agency work with they and american industry and labor as a whole
 no great effort like this can be a hundred percent perfect but the batting average be very very high
 and so i extend the congratulation and thank tonight of the american people to general alexander who have be in command of the whole italian operation to our general clark and general leese of the fifth and the eighth armies to general wilson the supreme allied commander of the mediterranean theater to and general devers his american deputy to lieutenant general eaker to admirals cunningham and hewitt and to all their brave officer and man
 may god bless they and watch over they and over all of our gallant fight man

lady and gentlemen
 all our fight man overseas today have their appoint station on the far fling battlefront of the world we at home have our too we need we and be proud of our fight man most decidedly but during the anxious time ahead let we not forget that they need we too
 it go almost without say that we must continue to forge the weapon of victory the hundred of thousand of item large and small essential to the waging of the war this have be the major task from the very start and it be still a major task this be the very bad time for any war worker to think of leave his machine or to look for a peacetime job
 and it go almost without say too that we must continue to provide our government with the fund necessary for wage war not only by the payment of taxis which after all be an obligation of american citizenship but also by the purchase of war bonds an act of free choice which every citizen have to make for himself under the guidance of his own conscience
 whatever else any of we may be do the purchase of war bonds and stamp be something all of we can do and should do to help win the war
 i be happy to report tonight that it be something which something nearly everyone seem to be do although there be now approximately sixty seven million person who have or earn some form of income include the armed force eighty one million person or their child have already buy war bond they have buy more than six hundred million individual bond their purchase have total more than thirty two billion dollar these be the purchase of individual man woman and child anyone who would have say this be possible a few year ago would have be put down as a starry eyed visionary but of such vision however be the stuff of america fashion
 of course there be always pessimist with we everywhere a few here and a few there i be remind of the fact that after the fall of france in 1940 i ask the congress for the money for the production by the united states of fifty thousand airplane per year well i be call crazy it be say that the figure be fantastic that it could not be do and yet today we be build airplane at the rate of one hundred thousand a year
 there be a direct connection between the bond you have buy and the stream of man and equipment now rush over the english channel for the liberation of europe there be a direct connection between your war bond and every part of this global war today
 tonight therefore on the opening of this fifth war loan drive it be appropriate for we to take a broad look at this panorama of world war for the success or the failure of the drive be go to have so much to do with the speed with which we can accomplish victory and the peace
 while i know that the chief interest tonight be center on the english channel and on the beach and farm and the city of normandy we should not lose sight of the fact that our armed force be engage on other battlefront all over the world and that no one front can be consider alone without its proper relation to all
 it be worth while therefore to make over all comparison with the past let we compare today with just two year ago june 1942 at that time germany be in control of practically all of europe and be steadily drive the russians back toward the ural mountains germany be practically in control of north africa and the mediterranean and be beat at the gate of the suez canal and the route to india italy be still an important military and supply factor as subsequent long campaign have prove
 japan be in control of the western aleutian islands and in the south pacific be knock at the gate of australia and new zealand and also be threaten india japan she have seize control of nearly one half of the central pacific
 american armed force on land and sea and in the air be still very definitely on the defensive and in the building up stage our allies be bear the heat and the brunt of the attack
 in 1942 washington heave a sigh of relief that the first war bond issue have be cheerfully over subscribe by the american people way back in those day two year ago america be still hear from many amateur strategist and political critic some of whom be do more good for hitler than for the united states two year ago
 but today we be on the offensive all over the world bring the attack to our enemy
 in the pacific by relentless submarine and naval attack and amphibious thrust and ever mount air attack we have deprive the japs of the power to check the momentum of our ever grow and ever advance military force we have reduce the japs their shipping by more than three million ton we have overcome their original advantage in the air we have cut off from a return to the homeland cut off from that return ten of thousand of beleaguered japanese troop who now face starvation or ultimate surrender and we have cut down their naval strength so that for many month they have avoid all risk of encounter with our naval force
 true we still have a long way to go to tokyo but carry out our original strategy of eliminate our european enemy first and then turn all our strength to the pacific we can force the japanese to unconditional surrender or to national suicide much more rapidly than have be think possible
 turn now to our enemy who be first on the list for destruction --germany have she back against the wall in fact three wall at once
 in the south we have break the german hold on central italy on june fourth the city of rome fall to the allied army and allow the enemy no respite the allies be now press hard on the heel of the germans as they retreat northward in ever grow confusion
 on the east our gallant soviet allies have drive the enemy back from the land which be invade three year ago the great soviet army be now initiate crush blow
 overhead vast allied air fleet of bomber and fighter have be wage a bitter air war over germany and western europe they have have two major objective to destroy german war industry which maintain the german army and air force and to shoot the german luftwaffe out of the air as a result german production have be whittle down continuously and the german fighter force now have have only a fraction of their its former power
 this great air campaign strategic and tactical be go to will continue --with increase power
 and on the west the hammer blow which strike the coast of france last tuesday morning less than a week ago be the culmination of many month of careful planning and strenuous preparation
 million of ton of weapon and supply and hundred of thousand of man assemble in england be now be pour into the great battle in europe
 i think that from the standpoint of our enemy we have achieve the impossible we have break through their supposedly impregnable wall in northern france but the assault have be costly in man and costly in material some of our landing be desperate adventure but from advice receive so far the loss be low than our commander have estimate would occur we have establish a firm foothold we and be now prepared to meet the inevitable counter attack of the germans with power and with confidence and we all pray that we will have far more soon than a firm foothold
 americans have all work together to make this day possible
 the liberation force now stream across the channel and up the beach and through the field and the forest down the highway of france be use thousand and thousand of plane and ship and tank and heavy gun they be carry with they many thousand of item need for their dangerous stupendous undertaking there be a shortage of nothing nothing and this must continue
 what have be do in the united states since those day of 1940 when france fall in raise and equip and transport our fighting force and in produce weapon and supply for war have be nothing short of a miracle it be largely due to american teamwork teamwork among capital and labor and agriculture between the armed force and the civilian economy indeed among all of they
 and every one every man or woman or child who buy a war bond help and help mightily
 there be still many people in the united states who have not buy war bonds or who have not buy as many as they can afford everyone know for himself whether he fall into that category or not in some case his neighbor know too also to the conscience of those people this appeal by the president of the united states be very much in order
 for all of the thing which we use in this war everything we send to our fight allies cost money a lot of money one sure way every man woman and child can keep faith with those who have give and be give their life be to provide the money which be need to win the final victory
 i urge all americans to buy war bonds without stint swell the mighty chorus to bring we near to victory

i have already indicate to you why i accept the nomination that you have offer i in spite of my desire to retire to the quiet of private life
 you in this convention be aware of what i have seek to gain for the nation and you have ask i to continue
 it seem wholly likely that within the next four year our armed force and those of our ally will have gain a complete victory over germany and japan soon or later and that the world once more will be at peace under a system we hope that will prevent a new world war in an event whenever that time come new hand will then have full opportunity to realize the ideal which we seek
 in the last three election the people of the united states have transcend party affiliation not only democrats but also forward look republicans and million of independent voter have turn to progressive leadership a leadership which have seek consistently and with fair success to advance the lot of the average american citizen who have be so forget during the period after the last war i be confident that they will continue to look to that same kind of liberalism to build our safe economy for the future
 i be sure that you will understand i when i say that my decision express to you formally tonight be base solely on a sense of obligation to serve if call upon to do so by the people of the united states
 i shall not campaign in the usual sense for the office in these day of tragic sorrow i do not consider it fitting and besides in these day of global warfare i shall not be able to find the time i shall however feel free to report to the people the fact about matter of concern to they and especially to correct any misrepresentation
 during the past few day i have be come across the whole width of the continent to a naval base where i be speak to you now from the train
 as i be cross the fertile land and the wide plain and the great divide i could not fail to think of the new relationship between the people of our farm and city and village and the people of the rest of the world overseas on the island of the pacific in the far east and in the
 other americas in britain and normandy and germany and poland and russia
 itself
 for oklahoma and california for example be become a part of all these distant spot as greatly as massachusetts and virginia be a part of the european picture in 1778 today oklahoma and california be be defend in normandy and on saipan and they must be defend there for what happen in normandy and saipan vitally affect the security and well being of every human being in oklahoma and california
 mankind change the scope and the breadth of its thought and vision slowly indeed in the day of the roman empire eye be focus on europe and the mediterranean area the civilization in the far east be barely know the american continent be unheard of
 and even after the people of europe begin to spill over to other continent the people of north america in colonial day know only their atlantic seaboard and a tiny portion of the other americas and they turn mostly for trade and international relationship to europe africa at that time be consider only as the provider of human chattel asia be essentially unknown to our ancestor
 during the nineteenth century during that era of development and expansion on this continent we feel a natural isolation geographic economic and political an isolation from the vast world which lie overseas
 not until this generation roughly this century have people here and elsewhere be compel more and more to widen the orbit of their vision to include every part of the world yes it have be a wrench perhaps but a very necessary one
 it be good that we be all get that broad vision for we shall need it after the war the isolationist and the ostrich who plague our thinking before pearl harbor be become slowly extinct the american people now know that all nation of the world large and small will have to play their appropriate part in keep the peace by force and in decide peacefully the dispute which might lead to war
 we all know how truly the world have become one that if germany and japan for example be to come through this war with their philosophy establish and their army intact our own grandchild would again have to be fight in their day for their liberty and their life
 some day soon we shall all be able to fly to any other part of the world within twenty four hour ocean will no long figure as greatly in our physical defense as they have in the past for our own safety and for our own economic good therefore if for no other reason we must take a leading part in the maintenance of peace and in the increase of trade among all the nation of the world
 and that be why your government for many many month have be lay plan and study the problem of the near future prepare itself to act so that the people of the united states may not suffer hardship after the war may continue constantly to improve their standard and may join with other nations in do the same there be even now work toward that end the good staff in all our history man and woman of all party and from every part of the nation i realize that planning be a word which in some place bring forth sneer but for example before our entry into the war it be plan which make possible the magnificent organization and equipment of the army and navy of the united states which be fight for we and for our civilization today
 improvement through planning be the order of the day even military affair thing do not stand still an army or a navy train and equipped and fighting accord to a 1932 model would not have be a safe reliance in 1944 and if we be to progress in our civilization improvement be necessary in other field in the physical thing that be a part of our daily life and also in the concept of social justice at home and abroad
 i be now at this naval base in the performance of my duty under the constitution the war wait for no election decision must be make plan must be lay strategy must be carry out they do not concern merely a party or a group they will affect the daily life of americans for generation to come
 what be the job before we in 1944 first to win the war to win the war fast to win it overpoweringly second to form worldwide international organization and to arrange to use the armed force of the sovereign nations of the world to make another war impossible within the foreseeable future and third to build an economy for our return veteran and for all americans which will provide employment and provide decent standard of living
 the people of the united states will decide this fall whether they wish to turn over this 1944 job this worldwide job to inexperienced or immature hand to those who oppose lend lease and international cooperation against the force of aggression and tyranny until they could read the poll of popular sentiment or whether they wish to leave it to those who see the danger from abroad who meet it head on and who now have seize the offensive and carry the war to its present stage of success to those who by international conference and united action have begin to build that kind of common understanding and cooperative experience which will be so necessary in the world to come
 they will also decide these people of our whether they will entrust the task of postwar reconversion to those who offer the veteran of the last war breadline and apple selling and who finally lead the american people down to the abyss of 1932 or whether they will leave it to those who rescue american business agriculture industry finance and labor in 1933 and who have already plan and put through much legislation to help our veteran resume their normal occupation in a well order reconversion process
 they will not decide these question by read glow word or platform pledge the mouthing of those who be willing to promise anything and
 everything contradiction inconsistency impossibility anything which might snare a few vote here and a few vote there
 they will decide on the record the record write on the sea on the land and in the sky
 they will decide on the record of our domestic accomplishment in recovery and reform since march 4 1933
 and they will decide on the record of our war production and food
 production unparalleled in all history in spite of the doubt and sneer of those in high place who say it can not be do
 they will decide on the record of the international food conference of u.n.r.r.a. of the international labor conference of the international education conference of the international monetary conference
 and they will decide on the record write in the atlantic charter at casablanca at cairo at moscow and at teheran
 we have make mistake who have not
 thing will not always be perfect be they ever perfect in human affair
 but the objective at home and abroad have always be clear before we constantly we have make steady sure progress toward that objective the record be plain and unmistakable as to that a record for everyone to read
 the great wartime president in our history after a wartime election which he call the most reliable indication of public purpose in this country set the goal for the united states a goal in term as applicable today as they be in 1865 term which the human mind can not improve
 .with firmness in the right as god give we to see the right let we strive on to finish the work we be in to bind up the nation 's wound to care for he who shall have bear the battle and for his widow and his orphan to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and last peace among ourselves and with all nation

mr. chief justice mr. vice president my friend
 you will understand and i believe agree with my wish that the form of this inauguration be simple and its word brief
 we americans of today together with our ally be pass through a period of supreme test it be a test of our courage of our resolve of our wisdom of our essential democracy
 if we meet that test successfully and honorably we shall perform a service of historic importance which man and woman and child will honor throughout all time
 as i stand here today having take the solemn oath of office in the presence of my fellow countryman in the presence of our god i know that it
 be america 's purpose that we shall not fail
 in the day and the year that be to come we shall work for ajust and honorable peace a durable peace as today we work and fight for total victory in war
 we can and we will achieve such a peace
 we shall strive for perfection we shall not achieve it immediately but we still shall strive we may make mistake but they must never be mistake which result from faintness of heart or abandonment of moral
 principle
 i remember that my old schoolmaster dr. peabody say in day that seem to we then to be secure and untroubled thing in life will not always run smoothly sometimes we will be rise toward the height then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward the great fact to remember be that the trend of civilization itself be forever upward that a line draw through the middle of the peak and the valley of the century always have an upward trend
 our constitution of 1787 be not a perfect instrument it be not perfect yet but it provide a firm base upon which all manner of man of all race and color and creed could build our solid structure of democracy
 today in this year of war 1945 we have learn lesson at a fearful cost and we shall profit by they
 we have learn that we can not live alone at peace that our own well being be dependent on the well being of other nation far away we have learn that we must live as man and not as ostrich nor as dog in the manger
 we have learn to be citizen of the world member of the human community
 we have learn the simple truth as emerson say that the only way to have a friend be to be one
 we can gain no last peace if we approach it with suspicion and mistrust or with fear we can gain it only if we proceed with the understanding and the confidence and the courage which flow from conviction
 the almighty god have bless our land in many way he have give our people stout heart and strong arm with which to strike mighty blow for freedom and truth he have give to our country a faith which have become the hope of all people in an anguished world
 so we pray to he now for the vision to see our way clearly to see the way that lead to a well life for ourselves and for all our fellow man and to the achievement of his will to peace on earth

 poland

 a new situation have be create in poland as a result of her complete liberation by the red army this call for the establishment of a polish provisional government which can be more broadly base than be possible before the recent liberation of western poland the provisional government which be now function in poland should therefore be reorganize on a broad democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leader from poland itself and from poles abroad this new government should then be call the polish provisional government of national unity

 winston s. churchill
 franklin d. roosevelt
 j. stalin
i hope that you will pardon i for this unusual posture of sit down during the presentation of what i want to say but i know that you will realize that it make it a lot easy for i not to have to carry about ten pound of steel around on the bottom of my leg and also because of the fact that i have just complete a fourteen thousand mile trip
 first of all i want to say it be good to be home
 it have be a long journey i hope you will also agree that it have be so far a fruitful one
 speak in all frankness the question of whether it be entirely fruitful or not lie to a great extent in your hand for unless you here in the hall of the american congress- with the support of the american people concur in the general conclusion reach at yalta and give they your active support the meeting will not have produce last result
 that be why i have come before you at the early hour i could after my return i want to make a personal report to you and at the same time to the people of the country many month of earnest work be ahead of we all and i should like to feel that when the last stone be lay on the structure of international peace it will be an achievement for which all of we in america have work steadfastly and unselfishly together
 i be return from this trip that take i so far refresh and inspire i be well the entire time i be not ill for a second until i arrive back in washington and there i hear all of the rumor which have occur in my absence i return from the trip refresh and inspire the roosevelt be not as you may suspect averse to travel we seem to thrive on it
 far away as i be i be keep constantly inform of affair in the united states the modern miracle of rapid communication have make this world very small we must always bear in mind that fact when we speak or think of international relation i receive a steady stream of message from washington i might say from not only the executive branch with all its department but also from the legislative branch and except where radio silence be necessary for security purpose i could continuously send message any place in the world and of course in a grave emergency we could have even risk the breaking of the security rule
 i come from the crimea conference with a firm belief that we have make a good start on the road to a world of peace
 there be two main purpose in this crimea conference the first be to bring defeat to germany with the great possible speed and the small possible loss of allied man that purpose be now be carry out in great force the german army and the german people be feel the ever increase might of our fight man and of the allied army every hour give we add pride in the heroic advance of our troop in germany on german soil toward a meeting with the gallant red army
 the second purpose be to continue to build the foundation for an international accord that would bring order and security after the chaos of the war that would give some assurance of last peace among the nations of the world
 toward that goal also a tremendous stride be make
 at teheran a little over a year ago there be long range military plan lay by the chiefs of staff of the three most powerful nation among the civilian leader at teheran however at that time there be only exchange of view and expression of opinion no political arrangement be make and none be attempt
 at the crimea conference however the time have come for get down to specific case in the political field
 there be on all side at this conference an enthusiastic effort to reach an agreement since the time of teheran a year ago there have develop among all of we a what shall i call it?—a great facility in negotiate with each other that augur well for the peace of the world we know each other well
 i have never for an instant waver in my belief that an agreement to insure world peace and security can be reach
 there be a number of thing that we do that be concrete that be definite for instance the lapse of time between teheran and yalta without conference of civilian representative of the three major power have prove to be too long fourteen month during that long period local problem be permit to become acute in place like poland and greece and italy and yugoslavia
 therefore we decide at yalta that even if circumstance make it impossible for the head of the three government to meet more often in the future we would make sure that there would be more frequent personal contact for the exchange of view between the secretaries of state and the foreign ministers of these three power
 we arrange for periodic meeting at interval of three or four month i feel very confident that under this arrangement there will be no recurrence of the incident which this winter disturb the friend of world wide cooperation and collaboration
 when we meet at yalta in addition to lay our strategic and tactical plan for the complete and final military victory over germany there be other problem of vital political consequence
 for instance first there be the problem of the occupation and control of germany after victory the complete destruction of her military power and the assurance that neither the nazis nor prussian militarism could again be revive to threaten the peace and the civilization of the world
 second again for example there be the settlement of the few difference that remain among we with respect to the international security organization after the dumbarton oaks conference as you remember at that time i say that we have agree ninety percent well that be a pretty good percentage i think the other ten percent be iron out at yalta
 third there be the general political and economic problem common to all of the area which have be or would be liberate from the nazi yoke this be a very special problem we over here find it difficult to understand the ramification of many of these problem in foreign land but we be try to
 fourth there be the special problem create by a few instance such as poland and yugoslavia
 day be spend in discuss these momentous matter and we argue freely and frankly across the table but at the end on every point unanimous agreement be reach and more important even than the agreement of word i may say we achieve a unity of thought and a way of get along together
 of course we know that it be hitler 's hope and the german war lords'—that we would not agree that some slight crack might appear in the solid wall of allied unity a crack that would give he and his fellow gangster one last hope of escape their just doom that be the objective for which his propaganda ma- chine have be work for many month
 but hitler have fail
 never before have the major allies be more closely united not only in their war aim but also in their peace aim and they be determined to continue to be unite with each other and with all peace love nation so that the ideal of last peace will become a reality
 the soviet british and united states chiefs of staff hold daily meeting with each other they confer frequently with marshal stalin and with prime minister churchill and with i on the problem of coordinate the strategic and tactical effort of the allied power they complete their plan for the final knock out blow to germany
 at the time of the teheran conference the russian front be remove so far from the american and british front that while certain long range strategic cooperation be possible there could be no tactical day by day coordination they be too far apart but russian troop have now cross poland they be fight on the eastern soil of germany herself british and american troop be now on german soil close to the rhine river in the west it be a different situation today from what it be fourteen month ago a close tactical liaison have become possible for the first time in europe and in the crimea conference that be something else that be accomplish
 provision be make for daily exchange of information between the army under the command of general eisenhower on the western front and those army under the command of the soviet marshal on that long eastern front and also with our army in italy without the necessity of go through the chiefs of staff in washington or london as in the past
 you have see one result of this exchange of information in the recent bombing by american and english aircraft of point which be directly relate to the russian advance on berlin
 from now on american and british heavy bomber will be use in the day by day tactic of the war and we have begin to realize i think that there be all the difference in the world between tactic on the one side and strategy on the other day by day tactic of the war in direct support of the soviet army as well as in the support of our own on the western front
 they be now engage in bombing and strafe in order to hamper the movement of german reserve and material to the eastern and western front from other part of germany or from italy
 arrangement have be make for the most effective distribution of all available material and transportation to the place where they can well be use in the combine war effort american british and russian
 detail of these plan and arrangement be military secret of course but this tie of thing in together be go to hasten the day of the final collapse of germany the nazis be learn about some of they already to their sorrow and i think all three of we at the conference feel that they will learn more about they tomorrow and the next day and the day after that
 there will be no respite for they we will not desist for one moment until unconditional surrender
 you know i have always feel that common sense prevail in the long run quiet overnight thinking i think that be true in germany just as much as it be here
 the german people as well as the german soldier must realize that the soon they give up and surrender by group or as individual the soon their present agony will be over they must realize that only with complete surrender can they begin to reestablish themselves as people whom the world might accept as decent neighbor
 we make it clear again at yalta and i now repeat that unconditional surrender do not mean the destruction or enslavement of the german people the nazi leader have deliberately withhold that part of the yalta declaration from the german press and radio they seek to convince the people of germany that the yalta declaration do mean slavery and destruction for they they be work at it day and night for that be how the nazis hope to save their own skin and deceive their people into continued and useless resistance
 we do however make it clear at the conference just what unconditional surrender do mean for germany
 it mean the temporary control of germany by great britain russia france and the united states each of these nations will occupy and control a separate zone of germany and the administration of the four zone will be coordinate in berlin by a control council compose of representative of the four nation
 unconditional surrender mean something else it mean the end of nazism it mean the end of the nazi party and of all its barbaric law and institution
 it mean the termination of all militaristic influence in the public private and cultural life of germany
 it mean for the nazi war criminal a punishment that be speedy and just and severe
 it mean the complete disarmament of germany the destruction of its militarism and its military equipment the end of its production of armament the dispersal of all its armed force the permanent dismemberment of the german general staff which have so often shatter the peace of the world
 it mean that germany will have to make reparation in kind for the damage which have be do to the innocent victim of its aggression
 by compelling reparation in kind in plant in machinery in rolling stock and in raw material we shall avoid the mistake that we and other nations make after the last war the demanding of reparation in the form of money which germany could never pay
 we do not want the german people to starve or to become a burden on the rest of the world
 our objective in handle germany be simple it be to secure the peace of the rest of the world now and in the future too much experience have show that that objective be impossible if germany be allow to retain any ability to wage aggressive warfare
 these objective will not hurt the german people on the contrary they will protect they from a repetition of the fate which the general staff and kaiserism impose on they before and which hitlerism be now impose upon they again a hundredfold it will be remove a cancer from the german body politic which for generation have produce only misery and only pain to the whole world
 during my stay in yalta i see the kind of reckless senseless fury the terrible destruction that come out of german militarism yalta on the black sea have no military significance of any kind it have no defense
 before the last war it have be a resort for people like the czars and prince and for the aristocracy of russia and the hanger on however after the red revolution and until the attack on the soviet union by hitler the palace and the villa of yalta have be use as a rest and recreation center by the russian people
 the nazi officer take these former palace and villa take they over for their own use the only reason that the so call former palace of the czar be still habitable when we get there be that it have be give or he think it have be give to a german general for his own property and his own use and when yalta be so destroy he keep soldier there to protect what he think would become his own nice villa it be a useful rest and recreation center for hundred of thousand of russian worker farmer and their family up to the time that it be take again by the germans the nazi officer take these place for their own use and when the red army force the nazis out of the crimea almost just a year ago all of these villa be loot by the nazis and then nearly all of they be destroy by bomb place on the inside and even the humblest of the home of yalta be not spare
 there be little left of it except blank wall ruin destruction and desolation
 sevastopol that be a fortified port about forty or fifty mile away there again be a scene of utter destruction a large city with great navy yard and fortification i think less than a dozen building be leave intact in the entire city
 i have read about warsaw and lidice and rotterdam and coventry but i see sevastopol and yalta and i know that there be not room enough on earth for both german militarism and christian decency
 of equal importance with the military arrangement at the crimea conference be the agreement reach with respect to a general international organization for last world peace the foundation be lay at dumbarton oaks there be one point however on which agreement be not reach at dumbarton oaks it involve the procedure of voting in the security council i want to try to make it clear by make it simple it take i hour and hour to get the thing straight in my own mind and many conference
 at the crimea conference the americans make a proposal on this subject which after full discussion be i be glad to say unanimously adopt by the other two nation
 it be not yet possible to announce the term of that agreement publicly but it will be in a very short time
 when the conclusion reach with respect to voting in the security council be make known i think and i hope that you will find they a fair solution of this complicated and difficult problem they be found in justice and will go far to assure international cooperation in the maintenance of peace
 a conference of all the united nations of the world will meet in san francisco on april 25 1945 there we all hope and confidently expect to execute a definite charter of organization under which the peace of the world will be preserve and the force of aggression permanently outlaw
 this time we be not make the mistake of wait until the end of the war to set up the machinery of peace this time as we fight together to win the war finally we work together to keep it from happen again
 i as you know have always be a believer in the document call the constitution of the united states and i spend a good deal of time in educate two other nations of the world in regard to the constitution of the united states the charter have to be and should be approve by the senate of the united states under the constitution i think the other nations all know it now i be aware of that fact and now all the other nations be and we hope that the senate will approve of what be set forth as the charter of the united nations when they all come together in san francisco next month
 the senate of the united states through its appropriate representative have be keep continuously advise of the program of this government in the creation of the international security organization
 the senate and the house of representatives will both be represent at the san francisco conference the congressional delegate to the san francisco conference will consist of an equal number of republican and democratic member the american delegation be in every sense of the word bipartisan
 world peace be not a party question i think that republicans want peace just as much as democrats it be not a party question any more than be military victory the winning of the war
 when the republic be threaten first by the nazi clutch for world conquest back in 1940 and then by the japanese treachery in 1941 partisanship and politic be lay aside by nearly every american and every resource be dedicate to our common safety the same consecration to the cause of peace will be expect i think by every patriotic american and by every human soul overseas
 the structure of world peace can not be the work of one man or one party or one nation it can not be just an american peace or a british peace or a russian a french or a chinese peace it can not be a peace of large nations- or of small nation it must be a peace which rest on the cooperative effort of the whole world
 it can not be a structure of complete perfection at first but it can be a peace and it will be a peace base on the sound and just principle of the atlantic charter on the concept of the dignity of the human being and on the guarantee of tolerance and freedom of religious worship
 as the allied army have march to military victory they have liberate people whose liberty have be crush by the nazis for four long year whose economy have be reduce to ruin by nazi despoiler
 there have be instance of political confusion and unrest in these liberate area that be not unexpected as in greece or in poland or in yugoslavia and there may be more bad than that there actually begin to grow up in some of these place queer idea of for instance sphere of influence that be incompatible with the basic principle of international collaboration if allow to go on unchecked these development might have have tragic result in time
 it be fruitless to try to place the blame for this situation on one particular nation or on another it be the kind of development that be almost inevitable unless the major power of the world continue without interruption to work together and to assume joint responsibility for the solution of problem that may arise to endanger the peace of the world
 we meet in the crimea determine to settle this matter of liberated area thing that might happen that we can not foresee at this moment might happen suddenly unexpectedly next week or next month and i be happy to confirm to the congress that we do arrive at a settlement and incidentally a unanimous settlement
 the three most powerful nations have agree that the political and economic problem of any area liberate from nazi conquest or of any former axis satellite be a joint responsibility of all three government they will join together during the temporary period of instability after hostility to help the people of any liberated area or of any former satellite state to solve their own problem through firmly establish democratic process
 they will endeavor to see to it that the people who carry on the interim government between occupation of germany and true independence will be as representative as possible of all democratic element in the population and that free election be hold as soon as possible thereafter
 responsibility for political condition thousand of mile away can no long be avoid by this great nation certainly i do not want to live to see another war as i have say the world be small small every year the united states now exert a tremendous influence in the cause of peace throughout all the world what we people over here be think and talk about be in the interest of peace because it be know all over the world the slight remark in either house of the congress be know all over the world the follow day we will continue to exert that influence only if we be willing to continue to share in the responsibility for keep the peace it will be our own tragic loss i think if we be to shirk that responsibility
 the final decision in these area be go to be make jointly and therefore they will often be a result of give and take compromise the united states will not always have its way a hundred percent nor will russia nor great britain we shall not always have ideal answer solution to complicated international problem even though we be determine continuously to strive toward that ideal but i be sure that under the agreement reach at yalta there will be a more stable political europe than ever before
 of course once there have be a free expression of the people 's will in any country our immediate responsibility ends- with the exception only of such action as may be agree on in the international security organization that we hope to set up
 the united nations must also soon begin to help these liberated area adequately to reconstruct their economy so that they be ready to resume their place in the world the nazi war machine have strip they of raw material and machine tool and truck and locomotive they have leave the industry of these place stagnant and much of the agricultural area be unproductive the nazis have leave a ruin in their wake
 to start the wheel run again be not a mere matter of relief it be to the national interest that all of we see to it that these liberated area be again make self support and productive so that they do not need continuous relief from we i should say that be an argument base on plain common sense
 one outstanding example of joint action by the three major allied power in the liberated area be the solution reach on poland the whole polish question be a potential source of trouble in postwar europe be it have be sometimes before and we come to the conference determine to find a common ground for its solution and we do even though everybody do not agree with we obviously
 our objective be to help to create a strong independent and prosperous nation that be the thing we must always remember those word agree to by russia by britain and by the united states the objective of make poland a strong independent and prosperous nation with a government ultimately to be select by the polish people themselves
 to achieve that objective it be necessary to provide for the formation of a new government much more representative than have be possible while poland be enslave there be as you know two government one in london one in lublin practically in russia accordingly step be take at yalta to reorganize the exist provisional government in poland on a broad democratic basis so as to include democratic leader now in poland and those abroad this new reorganize government will be recognize by all of we as the temporary government of poland poland need a temporary government in the bad way an ad interim government i think be another way of put it
 however the new polish provisional government of national unity will be pledge to hold a free election as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and a secret ballot
 throughout history poland have be the corridor through which attack on russia have be make twice in this generation germany have strike at russia through this corridor to insure european security and world peace a strong and independent poland be necessary to prevent that from happen again
 the decision with respect to the boundary of poland be frankly a compromise i do not agree with all of it by any mean but we do not go as far as britain want in certain area we do not go so far as russia want in certain area and we do not go so far as i want in certain area it be a compromise the decision be one however under which the poles will receive compensation in territory in the north and west in exchange for what they lose by the curzon line in the east the limit of the western border will be permanently fix in the final peace conference we know roughly that it will include in the new strong poland quite a large slice of what now be call germany and it be agree also that the new poland will have a large and long coast line and many new harbor also that most of east prussia will go to poland a corner of it will go to russia also that the anomaly of the free state of danzig will come to an end i think danzig would be a lot well if it be polish
 it be well know that the people east of the curzon line just for example here be why i compromise be predominantly white russian and ukrainian they be not polish and a very great majority of the people west of the line be predominantly polish except in that part of east prussia and eastern germany which will go to the new poland as far back as 1919 representative of the allies agree that the curzon line represent a fair boundary between the two people and you must remember also that there have not be any polish government before 1919 for a great many generation
 i be convinced that the agreement on poland under the circumstance be the most hopeful agreement possible for a free independent and prosperous polish state
 the crimea conference be a meeting of the three major military power on whose shoulder rest chief responsibility and burden of the war although for this reason france be not a participant in the conference no one should detract from the recognition that be accord there of her role in the future of europe and the future of the world
 france have be invite to accept a zone of control in germany and to participate as a fourth member of the allied control council of germany
 she have be invite to join as a sponsor of the international conference at san francisco next month
 she will be a permanent member of the international security council together with the other four major power
 and finally we have ask that france be associate with we in our joint responsibility over all the liberated area of europe
 agreement be reach on yugoslavia as announce in the communique and we hope that it be in process of fulfillment but not only there but in some other place we have to remember that there be a great many prima donna in the world all of they wish to be hear before anything become final so we may have a little delay while we listen to more prima donna
 quite naturally this conference concern itself only with the european war and with the political problem of europe and not with the pacific war
 in malta however our combine british and american staff make their plan to increase the attack against japan
 the japanese war lord know that they be not be over look they have feel the force of our b-29 's and our carrier plane they have feel the naval might of the united states and do not appear very anxious to come out and try it again
 the japs now know what it mean to hear that the united states marines have land and i think i can add that have iwo jima in mind the situation be well in hand
 they also know what be in store for the homeland of japan now that general macarthur have complete his magnificent march back to manila and now that admiral nimitz be establish air basis right in the back yard of japan itself in iwo jima
 but lest somebody else start to stop work in the united states i repeat what i have so often say in one short sentence even in my sleep we have not win the war yet"—with an s on war
 it be still a long tough road to tokyo it be long to go to tokyo than it be to berlin in every sense of the word the defeat of germany will not mean the end of the war against japan on the contrary we must be prepare for a long and costly struggle in the pacific
 but the unconditional surrender of japan be as essential as the defeat of germany i say that advisedly with the thought in mind that that be especially true if our plan for world peace be to succeed for japanese militarism must be wipe out as thoroughly as german militarism
 on the way back from the crimea i make arrangement to meet personally king farouk of egypt halle selassie the emperor of ethiopia and king ibn saud of saudi arabia our conversation have to do with matter of common interest they will be of great mutual advantage because they give i and a good many of we an opportunity of meeting and talk face to face and of exchange view in personal conversation instead of formal correspondence
 for instance on the problem of arabia i learn more about that whole problem the moslem problem the jewish problem by talk with ibn saud for five minute than i could have learn in the exchange of two or three dozen letter
 on my voyage i have the benefit of see the army and navy and the air force at work
 all americans i think would feel as proud of our armed force as i be if they could see and hear what i see and hear
 against the most efficient professional soldier and sailor and airman of all history our man stand and fought and win
 this be our chance to see to it that the son and the grandson of these gallant fight man do not have to do it all over again in a few year
 the conference in the crimea be a turning point i hope in our history and therefore in the history of the world there will soon be present to the senate of the united states and to the american people a great decision that will determine the fate of the united states and of the world for generation to come
 there can be no middle ground here we shall have to take the responsibility for world collaboration or we shall have to bear the responsibility for another world conflict
 i know that the word planning be not look upon with favor in some circle in domestic affair tragic mistake have be make by reason of lack of planning and on the other hand many great improvement in living and many benefit to the human race have be accomplish as a result of adequate intelligent planning reclamation of desert area development of whole river valley and provision for adequate housing
 the same will be true in relation between nation for the second time in the life of most of we this generation be face to face with the objective of prevent war to meet that objective the nations of the world will either have a plan or they will not the groundwork of a plan have now be furnish and have be submit to humanity for discussion and decision
 no plan be perfect whatever be adopt at san francisco will doubtless have to be amend time and again over the year just as our own constitution have be
 no one can say exactly how long any plan will last peace can endure only so long as humanity really insist upon it and be willing to work for it and sacrifice for it
 twenty five year ago american fight man look to the statesman of the world to finish the work of peace for which they fight and suffer we fail they then we can not fail they again and expect the world again to survive
 the crimea conference be a successful effort by the three lead nation to find a common ground for peace it ought to spell the end of the system of unilateral action the exclusive alliance the sphere of influence the balance of power and all the other expedient that have be try for century and have always fail
 we propose to substitute for all these a universal organization in which all peace love nation will finally have a chance to join
 i be confident that the congress and the american people will accept the result of this conference as the beginning of a permanent structure of peace upon which we can begin to build under god that well world in which our child and grandchild your and mine the child and grandchild of the whole world- must live and can live
 and that my friend be the principal message i can give you but i feel it very deeply as i know that all of you be feel it today and be go to feel it in the future

mr. speaker mr. president members of the congress
 it be with a heavy heart that i stand before you my friend and colleague in the congress of the united states
 only yesterday we lay to rest the mortal remain of our beloved president franklin delano roosevelt at a time like this word be inadequate the most eloquent tribute would be a reverent silence
 yet in this decisive hour when world event be move so rapidly our silence might be misunderstood and might give comfort to our enemy
 in his infinite wisdom almighty god have see fit to take from we a great man who love and be belove by all humanity
 no man could possibly fill the tremendous void leave by the passing of that noble soul no word can ease the aching heart of untold million of every race creed and color the world know it have lose a heroic champion of justice and freedom
 tragic fate have thrust upon us grave responsibility we must carry on our depart leader never look backward he look forward and move forward that be what he would want we to do that be what america will do
 so much blood have already be shed for the ideal which we cherish and for which franklin delano roosevelt live and die that we dare not permit even a momentary pause in the hard fight for victory
 today the entire world be look to america for enlightened leadership to peace and progress such a leadership require vision courage and tolerance it can be provide only by a united nation deeply devoted to the high ideal
 with great humility i call upon all americans to help i keep our nation unite in defense of those ideal which have be so eloquently proclaim by franklin roosevelt
 i want in turn to assure my fellow americans and all of those who love peace and liberty throughout the world that i will support and defend those ideal with all my strength and all my heart that be my duty and i shall not shirk it
 so that there can be no possible misunderstanding both germany and japan can be certain beyond any shadow of a doubt that america will continue the fight for freedom until no vestige of resistance remain
 we be deeply conscious of the fact that much hard fighting be still ahead of we
 have to pay such a heavy price to make complete victory certain america will never become a party to any plan for partial victory
 to settle for merely another temporary respite would surely jeopardize the future security of all the world
 our demand have be and it remain unconditional surrender
 we will not traffic with the breaker of the peace on the term of the peace
 the responsibility for making of the peace and it be a very grave responsibility must rest with the defender of the peace we be not unconscious of the dictate of humanity we do not wish to see unnecessary or unjustified suffering but the law of god and of man have be violate and the guilty must not go unpunished nothing shall shake our determination to punish the war criminal even though we must pursue they to the end of the earth
 last peace can never be secure if we permit our dangerous opponent to plot future war with impunity at any mountain retreat however distant
 in this shrink world it be futile to seek safety behind geographical barrier real security will be find only in law and in justice
 here in america we have labor long and hard to achieve a social order worthy of our great heritage in our time tremendous progress have be make toward a really democratic way of life let i assure the forward look people of america that there will be no relaxation in our effort to improve the lot of the common people
 in the difficult day ahead unquestionably we shall face problem of staggering proportion however with the faith of our father in our heart we do not fear the future
 on the battlefield we have frequently face overwhelming odd and win at home americans will not be less resolute
 we shall never cease our struggle to preserve and maintain our american way of life
 at this moment america along with her brave allies be pay again a heavy price for the defense of our freedom with characteristic energy we be assist in the liberation of entire nation gradually the shackle of slavery be be break by the force of freedom
 all of we be pray for a speedy victory every day peace be delay cost a terrible toll
 the army of liberation today be bring to an end hitler 's ghastly threat to dominate the world tokyo rock under the weight of our bomb
 the grand strategy of the united nations war have be determine due in no small measure to the vision of our depart commander in chief we be now carry out our part of that strategy under the able direction of admiral leahy general marshall admiral king general arnold general eisenhower admiral nimitz and general macarthur
 i want the entire world to know that this direction must and will remain unchanged and unhampered
 our debt to the heroic man and valiant woman in the service of our country can never be repay they have earn our undying gratitude america will never forget their sacrifice because of these sacrifice the dawn of justice and freedom throughout the world slowly cast its gleam across the horizon
 our forefather come to our rugged shore in search of religious tolerance political freedom and economic opportunity for those fundamental right they risk their life we well know today that such right can be preserve only by constant vigilance the eternal price of liberty
 within an hour after i take the oath of office i announce that the san francisco conference would proceed we will face the problem of peace with the same courage that we have face and master the problem of war
 in the memory of those who have make the supreme sacrifice in the memory of our fallen president we shall not fail
 it be not enough to yearn for peace we must work and if necessary fight for it the task of create a sound international organization be complicated and difficult yet without such organization the right of man on earth can not be protect machinery for the just settlement of international difference must be find without such machinery the entire world will have to remain an armed camp the world will be doom to deadly conflict devoid of hope for real peace
 fortunately people have retain hope for a durable peace thoughtful people have always have faith that ultimately justice must triumph past experience surely indicate that without justice an endure peace become impossible
 in bitter despair some people have come to believe that war be inevitable with tragic fatalism they insist that war have always be of necessity and of necessity war always will be to such defeatism man and woman of good will must not and can not yield the outlook for humanity be not so hopeless
 during the dark hour of this horrible war entire nation be keep go by something intangible hope when warn that abject submission offer the only salvation against overwhelming power hope show the way to victory
 hope have become the secret weapon of the force of liberation
 aggressor could not dominate the human mind as long as hope remain the spirit of man will never be crush
 but hope alone be not and be not sufficient to avert war we must not only have hope but we must have faith enough to work with other peace love nation to maintain the peace hope be not enough to beat back the aggressor as long as the peace love nation be unwilling to come to each other 's defense the aggressor be beat back only when the peace love nation unite to defend themselves
 if war in the future be to be prevent the nation must be unite in their determination to keep the peace under law
 nothing be more essential to the future peace of the world than continue cooperation of the nation which have to muster the force necessary to defeat the conspiracy of the axis power to dominate the world
 while these great state have a special responsibility to enforce the peace their responsibility be base upon the obligation rest upon all state large and small not to use force in international relation except in the defense of law the responsibility of the great state be to serve and not to dominate the world
 to build a foundation of endure peace we must not only work in harmony with our friend abroad but we must have the united support of our own people
 even the most experienced pilot can not bring a ship safely into harbor unless he have the full cooperation of the crew for the benefit of all every individual must do his duty
 i appeal to every american regardless of party race creed or color to support our effort to build a strong and last united nations organization
 you the members of the congress surely know how i feel only with your help can i hope to complete one of the great task ever assign to a public servant with divine guidance and your help we will find the new passage to a far well world a kindly and friendly world with just and last peace
 with confidence i be depend upon all of you
 to destroy greedy tyrant with dream of world domination we can not continue in successive generation to sacrifice our fine youth
 in the name of human decency and civilization a more rational method of decide national difference must and will be find
 america must assist suffer humanity back along the path of peaceful progress this will require time and tolerance we shall need also an abide faith in the people the kind of faith and courage which franklin delano roosevelt always have
 today america have become one of the most powerful force for good on earth we must keep it so we have achieve a world leadership which do not depend solely upon our military and naval might
 we have learn to fight with other nation in common defense of our freedom we must now learn to live with other nation for our mutual good we must learn to trade more with other nation so that there may be for our mutual advantage increase production increase employment and well standard of live throughout the world
 may we americans all live up to our glorious heritage
 in that way america may well lead the world to peace and prosperity
 at this moment i have in my heart a prayer as i have assume my heavy duty i humbly pray almighty god in the word of king solomon
 give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who be able to judge this thy so great a people
 i ask only to be a good and faithful servant of my lord and my people

this be a solemn but a glorious hour i only wish that franklin d. roosevelt have live to witness this day general eisenhower inform i that the force of germany have surrender to the united nations the flag of freedom fly over all europe
 for this victory we join in offer our thank to the providence which have guide and sustain we through the dark day of adversity
 our rejoicing be sober and subdue by a supreme consciousness of the terrible price we have pay to rid the world of hitler and his evil band let we not forget my fellow americans the sorrow and the heartache which today abide in the home of so many of our neighbor neighbor whose most priceless possession have be render as a sacrifice to redeem our liberty
 we can repay the debt which we owe to our god to our dead and to our child only by work by ceaseless devotion to the responsibility which lie ahead of we if i could give you a single watchword for the come month that word be work work and more work
 we must work to finish the war our victory be but half win the west be free but the east be still in bondage to the treacherous tyranny of the japanese when the last japanese division have surrender unconditionally then only will our fighting job be do
 we must work to bind up the wound of a suffer world to build an abide peace a peace root in justice and in law we can build such a peace only by hard toilsome painstaking work by understanding and work with our ally in peace as we have in war
 the job ahead be no less important no less urgent no less difficult than the task which now happily be do
 i call upon every american to stick to his post until the last battle be win until that day let no man abandon his post or slacken his effort and now i want to read to you my formal proclamation of this occasion
 a proclamation the allied army through sacrifice and devotion and with god 's help have wring from germany a final and unconditional surrender the western world have be free of the evil force which for five year and long have imprison the body and break the life of million upon million of free bear man they have violate their church destroy their home corrupt their child and murder their love one our army of liberation have restore freedom to these suffer people whose spirit and will the oppressor could never enslave
 much remain to be do the victory win in the west must now be win in the east the whole world must be cleanse of the evil from which half the world have be free united the peace love nation have demonstrate in the west that their arm be strong by far than the might of the dictator or the tyranny of military clique that once call we soft and weak the power of our people to defend themselves against all enemy will be prove in the pacific war as it have be prove in europe
 for the triumph of spirit and of arm which we have win and for its promise to the people everywhere who join we in the love of freedom it be fitting that we as a nation give thank to almighty god who have strengthen we and give we the victory
 now therefore i harry s. truman president of the united states of america do hereby appoint sunday may 13 1945 to be a day of prayer
 i call upon the people of the united states whatever their faith to unite in offer joyful thank to god for the victory we have win and to pray that he will support we to the end of our present struggle and guide we into the way of peace
 i also call upon my countryman to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have give their life to make possible our victory
 in witness whereof i have hereunto set my hand and cause the seal of the united states of america to be affix

sixteen hour ago an american airplane drop one bomb on hiroshima an important japanese army base that bomb have more power than 20,000 ton of t.n.t. it have more than two thousand time the blast power of the british grand slam which be the large bomb ever yet use in the history of warfare
 the japanese begin the war from the air at pearl harbor they have be repay many fold and the end be not yet with this bomb we have now add a new and revolutionary increase in destruction to supplement the grow power of our armed force in their present form these bomb be now in production and even more powerful form be in development
 it be an atomic bomb it be a harnessing of the basic power of the universe the force from which the sun draw its power have be loose against those who bring war to the far east
 before 1939 it be the accept belief of scientist that it be theoretically possible to release atomic energy but no one know any practical method of do it by 1942 however we know that the germans be work feverishly to find a way to add atomic energy to the other engine of war with which they hope to enslave the world but they fail we may be grateful to providence that the germans get the v-1&#39;s and v-2&#39;s late and in limited quantity and even more grateful that they do not get the atomic bomb at all
 the battle of the laboratory hold fateful risk for we as well as the battle of the air land and sea and we have now win the battle of the laboratory as we have win the other battle
 begin in 1940 before pearl harbor scientific knowledge useful in war be pool between the united states and great britain and many priceless help to our victory have come from that arrangement under that general policy the research on the atomic bomb be begin with american and british scientist work together we enter the race of discovery against the germans
 the united states have available the large number of scientist of distinction in the many needed area of knowledge it have the tremendous industrial and financial resource necessary for the project and they could be devoted to it without undue impairment of other vital war work in the united states the laboratory work and the production plant on which a substantial start have already be make would be out of reach of enemy bombing while at that time britain be expose to constant air attack and be still threaten with the possibility of invasion for these reason prime minister churchill and president roosevelt agree that it be wise to carry on the project here we now have two great plant and many less work devote to the production of atomic power employment during peak construction number 125,000 and over 65,000 individual be even now engage in operate the plant many have work there for two and a half year few know what they have be produce they see great quantity of material go in and they see nothing come out of these plant for the physical size of the explosive charge be exceedingly small we have spend two billion dollar on the great scientific gamble in history and win
 but the great marvel be not the size of the enterprise its secrecy nor its cost but the achievement of scientific brain in put together infinitely complex piece of knowledge hold by many man in different field of science into a workable plan and hardly less marvelous have be the capacity of industry to design and of labor to operate the machine and method to do thing never do before so that the brain child of many mind come forth in physical shape and perform as it be suppose to do both science and industry work under the direction of the united states army which achieve a unique success in manage so diverse a problem in the advancement of knowledge in an amazingly short time it be doubtful if such another combination could be get together in the world what have be do be the great achievement of organize science in history it be do under high pressure and without failure
 we be now prepared to obliterate more rapidly and completely every productive enterprise the japanese have above ground in any city we shall destroy their dock their factory and their communication let there be no mistake we shall completely destroy japan&#39;s power to make war
 it be to spare the japanese people from utter destruction that the ultimatum of july 26 be issue at potsdam their leader promptly reject that ultimatum if they do not now accept our term they may expect a rain of ruin from the air the like of which have never be see on this earth behind this air attack will follow sea and land force in such number and power as they have not yet see and with the fighting skill of which they be already well aware
 the secretary of war who have keep in personal touch with all phase of the project will immediately make public a statement give further detail
 his statement will give fact concern the site at oak ridge near knoxville tennessee and at richland near pasco washington and an installation near santa fe new mexico although the worker at the site have be make material to be use in produce the great destructive force in history they have not themselves be in danger beyond that of many other occupation for the utmost care have be take of their safety
 the fact that we can release atomic energy usher in a new era in man&#39;s understanding of nature&#39; force atomic energy may in the future supplement the power that now come from coal oil and fall water but at present it can not be produce on a basis to compete with they commercially before that come there must be a long period of intensive research
 it have never be the habit of the scientist of this country or the policy of this government to withhold from the world scientific knowledge normally therefore everything about the work with atomic energy would be make public
 but under present circumstance it be not intend to divulge the technical process of production or all the military application pende further examination of possible method of protect we and the rest of the world from the danger of sudden destruction
 i shall recommend that the congress of the united states consider promptly the establishment of an appropriate commission to control the production and use of atomic power within the united states i shall give further consideration and make further recommendation to the congress as to how atomic power can become a powerful and forceful influence towards the maintenance of world peace
my fellow americans

 i have just return from berlin the city from which the germans intend to rule the world it be a ghost city the building be in ruin its economy and its people be in ruin

 our party also visit what be leave of frankfurt and darmstadt we fly over the remain of kassel magdeburg and other devastated city german woman and child and old man be wander over the highway return to bomb out home or leave bomb out city search for food and shelter

 war have indeed come home to germany and to the german people it have come home in all the frightfulness with which the german leader start and wage it

 the german people be begin to atone for the crime of the gangster whom they place in power and whom they wholeheartedly approve and obediently follow

 we also see some of the terrific destruction which the war have bring to the occupy country of western europe and to england

 how glad i be to be home again and how grateful to almighty god that this land of our have be spare

 we must do all we can to spare she from the ravage of any future breach of the peace that be why though the united states want no territory or profit or selfish advantage out of this war we be go to maintain the military basis necessary for the complete protection of our interest and of world peace basis which our military expert deem to be essential for our protection and which be not now in our possession we will acquire we will acquire they by arrangement consistent with the united nations charter

 no one can foresee what another war would mean to our own city and our own people what we be do to japan now even with the new atomic bomb be only a small fraction of what would happen to the world in a third world war

 that be why the united nations be determined that there shall be no next war

 that be why the united nations be determined to remain united and strong we can never permit any aggressor in the future to be clever enough to divide we or strong enough to defeat we

 that be the guide spirit in the conference at san francisco

 that be the guide spirit in the conference of berlin

 that will be the guide spirit in the peace settlement to come

 in the conference of berlin it be easy for i to get along in mutual understanding and friendship with generalissimo stalin with prime minister churchill and later with prime minister attlee

 strong foundation of good will and cooperation have be lay by president roosevelt and it be clear that those foundation rest upon much more than the personal friendship of three individual there be a fundamental accord and agreement upon the objective ahead of we

 two of the three conferee of teheran and yalta be miss by the end of this conference each of they be sorely miss each have do his work toward win this war each have make a great contribution toward establish and maintain a last world peace each of they seem to have be ordain to lead his country in its hour of great need and so thoroughly have they do their job that we be able to carry on and to reach many agreement essential to the future peace and security of the world

 the result of the berlin conference have be publish there be no secret agreement or commitment apart from current military arrangement

 and it be make perfectly plain to my colleague at the conference that under our constitution the president have no power to make any treaty without ratification by the senate of the united states

 i want to express my thank for the excellent service which be render at this conference by secretary of state byrnes and which be highly commend by the leader of the other two power be thankful also to the other member of the american delegation admiral leahy and ambassadors harriman davy and pauley and to the entire american staff without their hard work and sound advice the conference would have be unable to accomplish as much as it do

 the conference be concern with many political and economic question but there be one strictly military matter uppermost in the mind of the american delegate it be the winning of the war against japan on our program that be the most important item

 the military arrangement make at berlin be of course secret one of those secret be reveal yesterday when the soviet union declare war on japan

 the soviet union before she have be inform of our new weapon agree to enter the war in the pacific we gladly welcome into this struggle against the last of the axis aggressor our gallant and victorious ally against the nazis

 the japs will soon learn some more of the other military secret agree upon at berlin they will learn they firsthand and they will not like they

 before we meet at berlin the united states government have send to the soviet and british government our idea of what should be take up at the conference at the first meeting our delegation submit these proposal for discussion subject be add by the soviet and british government but in the main the conference be occupy with the american proposal

 our first nonmilitary agreement in berlin be the establishment of the council of foreign ministers

 the council be go to be the continuous meeting ground of the five principal government on which to reach common understanding regard the peace settlement this do not mean that the five government be go to try to dictate to or dominate other nation it will be their duty to apply so far as possible the fundamental principle of justice underlie the charter adopt at san francisco

 just as the meeting at dumbarton oaks draw up the proposal to be place before the conference at san francisco so this council of foreign ministers will lay the groundwork for future peace settlement this preparation by the council will make possible speedy more orderly more efficient and more cooperative peace settlement than could otherwise be obtain

 one of the first task of the council of foreign ministers be to draft propose treaty of peace with former enemy country italy rumania bulgaria hungary and finland

 these treaty of course will have to be pass upon by all the nation concern in our own country the senate will have to ratify they but we shall begin at once the necessary preparatory work adequate study now may avoid the planting of the seed of future war

 i be sure that the american people will agree with i that this council of foreign ministers will be effective in hasten the day of peace and reconstruction

 we be anxious to settle the future of italy first among the former enemy country italy be the first to break away from the axis she help materially in the final defeat of germany she have now join we in the war against japan she be make real progress toward democracy

 a peace treaty with a democratic italian government will make it possible for we to receive italy as a member of the united nations

 the council of foreign ministers will also have to start the preparatory work for a german peace settlement but its final acceptance will have to wait until germany have develop a government with which a peace treaty can be make in the meantime the conference of berlin lay down the specific political and economic principle under which germany will be govern by the occupy power

 those principle have be publish i hope that all of you will read them.1

 1see item 91

 they seek to rid germany of the force which have make she so long fear and hate and which have now bring she to complete disaster they be intend to eliminate nazisre armament war industry the german general staff and all its military tradition they seek to rebuild democracy by control of german education by reorganize local government and the judiciary by encourage free speech free press freedom of religion and the right of labor to organize

 german industry be to be decentralize in order to do away with concentration of economic power in cartel and monopoly chief emphasis be to be on agriculture and peaceful industry german economic power to make war be to be eliminate the germans be not to have a high standard of living than their former victim the people of the defeated and occupy country of europe

 we be go to do what we can to make germany over into a decent nation so that it may eventually work its way from the economic chaos it have bring upon itself back into a place in the civilized world

 the economic action take against germany at the berlin conference include another most important item reparation

 we do not intend again to make the mistake of exact reparation in money and then lend germany the money with which to pay reparation this time be to be pay in physical asset from those resource of germany which be not require for her peacetime subsistence

 the first purpose of reparation be to take out of germany everything with which she can prepare for another war its second purpose be to help the devastated country to bring about their own recovery by mean of the equipment and material take from germany

 at the crimea conference a basis for fix reparation have be propose for initial discussion and study by the reparations commission that basis be a total amount of reparation of twenty billion of dollar of this sum one half be to go to russia which have suffer more heavily in the loss of life and property than any other country

 but at berlin the idea of attempt to fix a dollar value on the property to be remove from germany be drop to fix a dollar value on the share of each nation would be a sort of guarantee of the amount each nation would get a guarantee which might not be fulfil

 therefore it be decide to divide the property by percentage of the total amount available we still generally agree that russia should get approximately half of the total for herself and poland and that the remainder should be divide among all the other nation entitle to reparation

 under our agreement at berlin the reparation claim of the soviet union and poland be to be meet from the property locate in the zone of germany occupy by the soviet union and from the german asset in bulgaria finland hungary rumania and east austria the reparation claim of all the other country be to be meet from property locate in the western zone of occupation in germany and from the german asset in all other country the soviet waif all claim to gold capture by the allied troop in germany

 this formula of take reparation by zone will lead to less friction among the allies than the tentative basis originally propose for study at yalta

 the difficulty with this formula however be that the industrial capital equipment not necessary for german peace economy be not evenly divide among the zone of occupation the western zone have a much high percentage than the eastern zone which be mostly devoted to agriculture and to the production of raw material in order to equalize the distribution and to give russia and poland their fair share of approximately 50 percent it be decide that they should receive without any reimbursement 10 percent of the capital equipment in the western zone available for reparation

 as you will note from the communique a further 15 percent of the capital equipment in the western zone not necessary for germany&#39;s peace economy be also to be turn over to russia and poland but this be not free for this property poland and russia will give to the western zone an equal amount in value in food coal and other raw material this 15 percent therefore be not additional reparation for russia and poland it be a means of maintain a balanced economy in germany and provide the usual exchange of good between the eastern part and the western part

 it be agree at berlin that the payment of reparation from whatever zone take should always leave enough resource to enable the german people to subsist without sustained support from other nation

 the question of poland be a most difficult one certain compromise about poland have already be agree upon at the crimea conference they obviously be bind upon we at berlin

 by the time of the berlin conference the polish provisional government of national unity have already be form and it have be recognize by all of we the new polish government have agree to hold free and unfettered election as soon as possible on the basis of universal suffrage and the secret ballot

 in acceptance in accordance with the crimea agreement we do seek the opinion of the polish provisional government of national unity with respect to its western and northern boundary

 they agree as do we all that the final determination of the border could not be accomplish at berlin but must await the peace settlement however a considerable portion of what be the russian zone of occupation in germany be turn over to poland at the berlin conference for administrative purpose until the final determination of the peace settlement

 nearly every international agreement have in it the element of compromise the agreement on poland be no exception no one nation can expect to get everything that it want it be a question of give and take of be willing to meet your neighbor half way

 in this instance there be much to justify the action take the agreement on some line even provisionally be necessary to enable the new poland to organize itself and to permit the speedy withdrawal of the armed force which have liberate she from the germans in the area east of the curzon line there be over 3,000,000 poles who be to be return to poland they need room room to settle the new area in the west be formerly populate by german but most of they have already leave in the face of the invade soviet army we be inform that there be only about a million and a half left

 the territory the poles be to administer will enable poland well to support its population it will provide a short and more easily defensible frontier between poland and germany settle by poles it will provide a more homogeneous nation

 the three powers also agree to help bring about the early possible return to poland of all poles who wish to return include soldier with the assurance that they would have all the right of other polish citizen

 the action take at berlin will help carry out the basic policy of the united nations toward poland to create a strong independent and prosperous nation with a government to be select by the people themselves

 it be agree to recommend that in the peace settlement a portion of east prussia should be turn over to russia that too be agree upon at yalta it will provide the soviet union which do so much to bring about victory in europe with an ice free port at the expense of germany

 at yalta it be agree you will recall that the three government would assume a common responsibility in help to reestablish in the liberated and satellite nation of europe government broadly representative of democratic element in the population that responsibility still stand we all recognize it as a joint responsibility of the three government

 it be reaffirm in the berlin declarations on rumania bulgaria and hungary these nation be not to be sphere of influence of any one power they be now govern by allied control commission compose of representative of the three government which meet at yalta and berlin these control commission it be true have not be function completely to our satisfaction but improved procedure be agree upon at berlin until these state be reestablish as member of the international family they be the joint concern of all of we

 the american delegation be much disturb over the inability of the representative of a free press to get information out of the former german satellite nation the three government agree at berlin that the allied press would enjoy full freedom from now on to report to the world upon all development in rumania bulgaria hungary and finland the same agreement be reaffirm also as to poland

 one of the persistent cause for war in europe in the last two century have be the selfish control of the waterway of europe i mean the danube the black sea straits the rhine the kiel canal and all the inland waterway of europe which border upon two or more state

 the united states propose at berlin that there be free and unrestricted navigation of these inland waterway we think this be important to the future peace and security of the world we propose that regulation for such navigation be provide by international authority

 the function of the agency would be to develop the use of the waterway and assure equal treatment on they for all nation membership on the agency would include the united states great britain the soviet union and france plus those state which border on the waterway

 our proposal be consider by the conference and be refer to the council of ministers there the united states intend to press for its adoption

 any man who see europe now must realize that victory in a great war be not something you win once and for all like victory in a ball game victory in a great war be something that must be win and keep win it can be lose after you have win it if you be careless or negligent or indifferent

 europe today be hungry i be not talk about germans i be talk about the people of the country which be overrun and devastate by the germans and particularly about the people of western europe many of they lack clothe and fuel and tool and shelter and raw material they lack the mean to restore their city and their factory

 as the winter come on the distress will increase unless we do what we can to help we may lose next winter what we win at such terrible cost last spring desperate man be liable to destroy the structure of their society to find in the wreckage some substitute for hope if we let europe go cold and hungry we may lose some of the foundation of order on which the hope for worldwide peace must rest

 we must help to the limit of our strength and we will

 our meeting at berlin be the first meeting of the great allies since victory be win in europe naturally our thought now turn to the day of victory in japan

 the british chinese and united states governments have give the japanese people adequate warning of what be in store for they we have lay down the general term on which they can surrender our warning go unheeded our term be reject since then the japanese have see what our atomic bomb can do they can foresee what it will do in the future

 the world will note that the first atomic bomb be drop on hiroshima a military base that be because we wish in this first attack to avoid insofar as possible the killing of civilian but that attack be only a warning of thing to come if japan do not surrender bomb will have to be drop on her war industry and unfortunately thousand of civilian life will be lose i urge japanese civilian to leave industrial city immediately and save themselves from destruction

 i realize the tragic significance of the atomic bomb

 its production and its use be not lightly undertake by this government but we know that our enemy be on the search for it we know now how close they be to find it and we know the disaster which would come to this nation and to all peace love nation to all civilization if they have find it first

 that be why we felt compel to undertake the long and uncertain and costly labor of discovery and production

 we win the race of discovery against the germans

 having find the bomb we have use it we have use it against those who attack we without warn at pearl harbor against those who have starve and beat and execute american prisoner of war against those who have abandon all pretense of obey international law of warfare we have use it in order to shorten the agony of war in order to save the life of thousand and thousand of young americans

 we shall continue to use it until we completely destroy japan&#39;s power to make war only a japanese surrender will stop we

 the atomic bomb be too dangerous to be loose in a lawless world that be why great britain canada and the united states who have the secret of its production do not intend to reveal that secret until mean have be find to control the bomb so as to protect ourselves and the rest of the world from the danger of total destruction

 as far back as last may secretary of war stimson at my suggestion appoint a committee upon which secretary of state byrnes serve as my personal representative to prepare plan for the future control of this bomb i shall ask the congress to cooperate to the end that its production and use be control and that its power be make an overwhelming influence towards world peace

 we must constitute ourselves trustee of this new force to prevent its misuse and to turn it into the channel of service to mankind

 it be an awful responsibility which have come to we

 we thank god that it have come to we instead of to our enemy and we pray that he may guide we to use it in his way and for his purpose

 our victory in europe be more than a victory of arm

 it be a victory of one way of life over another it be a victory of an ideal found on the right of the common man on the dignity of the human being on the conception of the state as the servant and not the master of its people

 a free people show that it be able to defeat professional soldier whose only moral arm be obedience and the worship of force

 we tell ourselves that we have emerge from this war the most powerful nation in the world the most powerful nation perhaps in all history that be true but not in the sense some of we believe it to be true

 the war have show we that we have tremendous resource to make all the material for war it have show we that we have skillful worker and manager and able general and a brave people capable of bear arm

 all these thing we know before

 the new thing the thing which we have not know the thing we have learn now and should never forget be this that a society of self govern man be more powerful more enduring more creative than any other kind of society however discipline however centralize

 we know now that the basic proposition of the worth and dignity of man be not a sentimental aspiration or a vain hope or a piece of rhetoric it be the strong most creative force now present in this world

 now let we use that force and all our resource and all our skill in the great cause of a just and last peace

 the three great powers be now more closely than ever bind together in determination to achieve that kind of peace from teheran and the crimea from san francisco and berlin we shall continue to march together to a last peace and a happy world
the thought and hope of all america indeed of all the civilized world be center tonight on the battleship missouri there on that small piece of american soil anchor in tokyo harbor the japanese have just officially lay down their arm they have sign term of unconditional surrender
 four year ago the thought and fear of the whole civilized world be center on another piece of american soil pearl harbor the mighty threat to civilization which begin there be now lay at rest it be a long road to tokyo and a bloody one
 we shall not forget pearl harbor
 the japanese militarist will not forget the u.s.s. missouri
 the evil do by the japanese war lord can never be repair or forget but their power to destroy and kill have be take from they their army and what be leave of their navy be now impotent
 to all of we there come first a sense of gratitude to almighty god who sustain we and our allies in the dark day of grave danger who make we to grow from weakness into the strong fighting force in history and who have now see we overcome the force of tyranny that seek to destroy his civilization
 god grant that in our pride of the hour we may not forget the hard task that be still before we that we may approach these with the same courage zeal and patience with which we face the trial and problem of the past four year
 our first thought of course thought of gratefulness and deep obligation go out to those of our love one who have be kill or maim in this terrible war on land and sea and in the air american man and woman have give their life so that this day of ultimate victory might come and assure the survival of a civilized world no victory can make good their loss
 we think of those whom death in this war have hurt take from they father husband son brother and sister whom they love no victory can bring back the face they long to see
 only the knowledge that the victory which these sacrifice have make possible will be wisely use can give they any comfort it be our responsibility our the living to see to it that this victory shall be a monument worthy of the dead who die to win it
 we think of all the million of man and woman in our armed force and merchant marine all over the world who after year of sacrifice and hardship and peril have be spare by providence from harm
 we think of all the man and woman and child who during these year have carry on at home in lonesomeness and anxiety and fear
 our thought go out to the million of american worker and businessman to our farmer and miner to all those who have build up this country 's fighting strength and who have ship to our allies the mean to resist and overcome the enemy
 our thought go out to our civil servant and to the thousand of americans who at personal sacrifice have come to serve in our government during these try year to the member of the selective service board and ration board to the civilian defense and red cross worker to the man and woman in the uso and in the entertainment world to all those who have help in this cooperative struggle to preserve liberty and decency in the world
 we think of our depart gallant leader franklin d. roosevelt defender of democracy architect of world peace and cooperation
 and our thought go out to our gallant allies in this war to those who resist the invader to those who be not strong enough to hold out but who nevertheless keep the fire of resistance alive within the soul of their people to those who stand up against great odd and hold the line until the united nations together be able to supply the arm and the man with which to overcome the force of evil
 this be a victory of more than arm alone this be a victory of liberty over tyranny
 from our war plant roll the tank and plane which blast their way to the heart of our enemy from our shipyard spring the ship which bridge all the ocean of the world for our weapon and supply from our farm come the food and fiber for our army and navy and for our allies in all the corner of the earth from our mine and factory come the raw material and the finished product which give we the equipment to overcome our enemy
 but back of it all be the will and spirit and determination of a free people who know what freedom be and who know that it be worth whatever price they have to pay to preserve it
 it be the spirit of liberty which give we our armed strength and which make our man invincible in battle we now know that that spirit of liberty the freedom of the individual and the personal dignity of man be the strong and tough and most enduring force in all the world
 and so on v j day we take renew faith and pride in our own way of life we have have our day of rejoice over this victory we have have our day of prayer and devotion now let we set aside v j day as one of renew consecration to the principle which have make we the strong nation on earth and which in this war we have strive so mightily to preserve
 those principle provide the faith the hope and the opportunity which help man to improve themselves and their lot liberty do not make all man perfect nor all society secure but it have provide more solid progress and happiness and decency for more people than any other philosophy of government in history and this day have show again that it provide the great strength and the great power which man have ever reach
 we know that under it we can meet the hard problem of peace which have come upon we a free people with free allies who can develop an atomic bomb can use the same skill and energy and determination to overcome all the difficulty ahead
 victory always have its burden and its responsibility as well as its rejoicing
 but we face the future and all its danger with great confidence and great hope america can build for itself a future of employment and security together with the united nations it can build a world of peace round on justice fair dealing and tolerance
 as president of the united states i proclaim sunday september the second 1945 to be v j day the day of formal surrender by japan it be not yet the day for the formal proclamation of the end of the war nor of the cessation of hostility but it be a day which we americans shall always remember as a day of retribution as we remember that other day the day of infamy
 from this day we move forward we move toward a new era of security at home with the other united nations we move toward a new and well world of cooperation of peace and international good will and cooperation
 god 's help have bring we to this day of victory with his help we will attain that peace and prosperity for ourselves and all the world in the year ahead

mayor la guardia lady and gentleman

 in the harbor and river of new york city and in other port along the coast and river of the country ship of that mighty united states navy be at anchor i hope that you and the people everywhere will visit they and their crew see for yourself what your son and daughter your labor and your money have fashion into an invincible weapon of liberty
 the fleet on v j day consist of 1200 warship more than 50,000 support and landing craft and over 40,000 navy plane by that day our be a sea power never before equal in the history of the world there be great carrier task force capable of track down and sink the enemy 's fleet beat down his air power and pour destruction on his war make industry there be submarine which roam the sea invade the enemy 's own port and destroy his shipping in all the ocean there be amphibious force capable of land soldier on beach from normandy to the philippines there be great battleship and cruiser which sweep the enemy ship from the sea and bombard his shore defense almost at will
 and history will never forget that great leader who from his first day in office fight to reestablish a strong american navy who watch that navy and all the other might of this nation grow into an invincible force for victory who seek to make that force an instrument for a just and last peace and who give his life in the effort franklin d. roosevelt
 the roll call of the battle of this fleet read like a sign post around the globe on the road to final victory north africa sicily italy normandy and southern france the coral sea midway guadalcanal and the solomons tarawa saipan guam the philippine sea leyte gulf iwo jima and okinawa nothing which the enemy hold on any coast be safe from its attack
 now we be in the process of demobilize our naval force we be lay up ship we be break up aircraft squadron we be roll up basis and release officer and man but when our demobilization be all finish as plan the united states will still be the great naval power on earth
 in addition to that naval power we shall still have one of the most powerful air force in the world and just the other day so that on short notice we could mobilize a powerful and well equip land sea and air force i ask the congress to adopt universal training
 why do we seek to preserve this powerful naval and air force and establish this strong army reserve why do we need to do that
 we have assure the world time and again and i repeat it now that we do not seek for ourselves one inch of territory in any place in the world outside of the right to establish necessary basis for our own protection we look for nothing which belong to any other power
 we do need this kind of armed might however for four principal task
 first our army navy and air force in collaboration with our ally must enforce the term of peace impose upon our defeat enemy
 second we must fulfill the military obligation which we be undertake as a member of the united nations organization to support a last peace by force if necessary
 third we must cooperate with other american nation to preserve the territorial integrity and the political independence of the nation of the western hemisphere
 fourth in this troubled and uncertain world our military force must be adequate to discharge the fundamental mission lay upon they by the constitution of the united states to provide for the common defense of the united states
 these four military task be direct not toward war not toward conquest but toward peace
 we seek to use our military strength solely to preserve the peace of the world for we now know that this be the only sure way to make our own freedom secure
 that be the basis of the foreign policy of the people of the united states
 the foreign policy of the united states be base firmly on fundamental principle of righteousness and justice in carry out those principle we shall firmly adhere to what we believe to be right and we shall not give our approval to any compromise with evil
 but we know that we can not attain perfection in this world overnight we shall not let our search for perfection obstruct our steady progress toward international cooperation we must be prepared to fulfill our responsibility as well we can within the framework of our fundamental principle even though we recognize that we have to operate in an imperfect world
 let i restate the fundamental of that foreign policy of the united states
 1 we seek no territorial expansion or selfish advantage we have no plan for aggression against any other state large or small we have no objective which need clash with the peaceful aim of any other nation
 2 we believe in the eventual return of sovereign right and self government to all people who have be deprive of they by force
 3 we shall approve no territorial change in any friendly part of the world unless they accord with the freely express wish of the people concern
 4 we believe that all people who be prepare for self government should be permit to choose their own form of government by their own freely express choice without interference from any foreign source that be true in europe in asia in africa as well as in the western hemisphere
 5 by the combined and cooperative action of our war ally we shall help the defeat enemy state establish peaceful democratic government of their own free choice and we shall try to attain a world in which nazism fascism and military aggression can not exist
 6 we shall refuse to recognize any government impose upon any nation by the force of any foreign power in some case it may be impossible to prevent forceful imposition of such a government but the united states will not recognize any such government
 7 we believe that all nation should have the freedom of the sea and equal right to the navigation of boundary river and waterway and of river and waterway which pass through more than one country
 8 we believe that all state which be accept in the society of nation should have access on equal term to the trade and the raw material of the world
 9 we believe that the sovereign state of the western hemisphere without interference from outside the western hemisphere must work together as good neighbor in the solution of their common problem
 10 we believe that full economic collaboration between all nation great and small be essential to the improvement of living condition all over the world and to the establishment of freedom from fear and freedom from want
 11 we shall continue to strive to promote freedom of expression and freedom of religion throughout the peace love area of the world
 12 we be convince that the preservation of peace between nation require a united nations organization compose of all the peace love nation of the world who be willing jointly to use force if necessary to insure peace
 now that be the foreign policy which guide the united states that be the foreign policy with which it confidently face the future
 it may not be put into effect tomorrow or the next day but nonetheless it be our policy and we shall seek to achieve it it may take a long time but it be worth wait for and it be worth strive to attain
 the ten commandments themselves have not yet be universally achieve over these thousand of year yet we struggle constantly to achieve they and in many way we come close to they each year though we may meet setback from time to time we shall not relent in our effort to bring the golden rule into the international affair of the world
 we be now pass through a difficult phase of international relation unfortunately it have always be true after past war that the unity among ally forge by their common peril have tend to wear out as the danger pass
 the world can not afford any letdown in the united determination of the ally in this war to accomplish a lasting peace the world can not afford to let the cooperative spirit of the ally in this war disintegrate the world simply can not allow this to happen the people in the united states in russia and britain in france and china in collaboration with all the other peace love people must take the course of current history into their own hand and mold it in a new direction the direction of continued cooperation it be a common danger which unite we before victory let it be a common hope which continue to draw we together in the year to come
 the atomic bomb which fall on hiroshima and nagasaki must be make a signal not for the old process of fall apart but for a new era an era of ever close unity and ever close friendship among peaceful nation
 build a peace require as much moral stamina as wage a war perhaps it require even more because it be so laborious and painstaking and undramatic it require undye patience and continuous application but it can give we if we stay with it the great reward that there be in the whole field of human effort
 difference of the kind that exist today among nation that fight together so long and so valiantly for victory be not hopeless or irreconcilable there be no conflict of interest among the victorious power so deeply rooted that they can not be resolve but their solution will require a combination of forbearance and firmness it will require a steadfast adherence to the high principle which we have enunciate it will also require a willingness to find a common ground as to the method of apply those principle
 our american policy be a policy of friendly partnership with all peaceful nation and of full support for the united nations organization it be a policy that have the strong backing of the american people it be a policy around which we can rally without fear or misgive
 the more widely and clearly that policy be understand abroad the well and surer will be the peace for our own part we must seek to understand the special problem of other nation we must seek to understand their own legitimate urge toward security as they see it
 the immediate the great threat to we be the threat of disillusionment the danger of insidious skepticism a loss of faith in the effectiveness of international cooperation such a loss of faith would be dangerous at any time in an atomic age it would be nothing short of disastrous
 there have be talk about the atomic bomb scrap all navy army and air force for the present i think that such talk be 100 percent wrong today control of the sea rest in the fleet of the united states and her ally there be no substitute for they we have learn the bitter lesson that the weakness of this great republic invite man of ill will to shake the very foundation of civilization all over the world and we have two concrete lesson in that
 what the distant future of the atomic research will bring to the fleet which we honor today no one can foretell but the fundamental mission of the navy have not change control of our sea approach and of the sky above they be still the key to our freedom and to our ability to help enforce the peace of the world no enemy will ever strike we directly except across the sea we can not reach out to help stop and defeat an aggressor without cross the sea therefore the navy arm with whatever weapon science bring forth be still dedicate to its historic task control of the ocean approach to our country and of the sky above they
 the atomic bomb do not alter the basic foreign policy of the united states it make the development and application of our policy more urgent than we could have dream 6 month ago it mean that we must be prepare to approach international problem with great speed with great determination with great ingenuity in order to meet a situation for which there be no precedent
 we must find the answer to the problem create by the release of atomic energy we must find the answer to the many other problem of peace in partnership with all the people of the united nations for their stake in world peace be as great as our own
 as i say in my message to the congress discussion of the atomic bomb with great britain and canada and later with other nation can not wait upon the formal organization of the united nations these discussion look toward a free exchange of fundamental scientific information will be begin in the near future but i emphasize again as i have before that these discussion will not be concern with the process of manufacture the atomic bomb or any other instrument of war
 in our possession of this weapon as in our possession of other new weapon there be no threat to any nation the world which have see the united states in two great recent war know that full well the possession in our hand of this new power of destruction we regard as a sacred trust because of our love of peace the thoughtful people of the world know that that trust will not be violate that it will be faithfully execute
 indeed the high hope of the american people be that world cooperation for peace will soon reach such a state of perfection that atomic method of destruction can be definitely and effectively outlaw forever
 we have seek and we will continue to seek the attainment of that objective we shall pursue that course with all the wisdom patience and determination that the god of peace can bestow upon a people who be try to follow in his path

mr. president mr. speaker members of the congress of the united states
 the gravity of the situation which confront the world today necessitate my appearance before a joint session of the congress
 the foreign policy and the national security of this country be involve
 one aspect of the present situation which i present to you at this time for your consideration and decision concern greece and turkey
 the united states have receive from the greek government an urgent appeal for financial and economic assistance preliminary report from the american economic mission now in greece and report from the american ambassador in greece corroborate the statement of the greek government that assistance be imperative if greece be to survive as a free nation
 i do not believe that the american people and the congress wish to turn a deaf ear to the appeal of the greek government
 greece be not a rich country lack of sufficient natural resource have always force the greek people to work hard to make both end meet since 1940 this industrious peace love country have suffer invasion four year of cruel enemy occupation and bitter internal strife
 when force of liberation enter greece they find that the retreat germans have destroy virtually all the railway road port facility communication and merchant marine more than a thousand village have be burn eighty five percent of the child be tubercular livestock poultry and draft animal have almost disappear inflation have wipe out practically all saving
 as a result of these tragic condition a militant minority exploit human want and misery be able to create political chaos which until now have make economic recovery impossible
 greece be today without fund to finance the importation of those good which be essential to bare subsistence under these circumstance the people of greece can not make progress in solve their problem of reconstruction greece be in desperate need of financial and economic assistance to enable it to resume purchase of food clothing fuel and seed these be indispensable for the subsistence of its people and be obtainable only from abroad greece must have help to import the good necessary to restore internal order and security so essential for economic and political recovery
 the greek government have also ask for the assistance of experienced american administrator economist and technician to insure that the financial and other aid give to greece shall be use effectively in create a stable and self sustain economy and in improve its public administration
 the very existence of the greek state be today threaten by the terrorist activity of several thousand armed man lead by communists who defy the government 's authority at a number of point particularly along the northern boundary a commission appoint by the united nations security council be at present investigate disturb condition in northern greece and allege border violation along the frontier between greece on the one hand and albania bulgaria and yugoslavia on the other
 meanwhile the greek government be unable to cope with the situation the greek army be small and poorly equip it need supply and equipment if it be to restore authority to the government throughout greek territory
 greece must have assistance if it be to become a self support and self respect democracy
 the united states must supply this assistance we have already extend to greece certain type of relief and economic aid but these be inadequate
 there be no other country to which democratic greece can turn
 no other nation be willing and able to provide the necessary support for a democratic greek government
 the british government which have be help greece can give no far financial or economic aid after march 31 great britain find itself under the necessity of reduce or liquidate its commitment in several part of the world include greece
 we have consider how the united nations might assist in this crisis but the situation be an urgent one require immediate action and the united nations and its related organization be not in a position to extend help of the kind that be require
 it be important to note that the greek government have ask for our aid in utilize effectively the financial and other assistance we may give to greece and in improve its public administration it be of the utmost importance that we supervise the use of any fund make available to greece in such a manner that each dollar spend will count toward make greece self support and will help to build an economy in which a healthy democracy can flourish
 no government be perfect one of the chief virtue of a democracy however be that its defect be always visible and under democratic process can be point out and correct the government of greece be not perfect nevertheless it represent 85 percent of the member of the greek parliament who be choose in an election last year foreign observer include 692 americans consider this election to be a fair expression of the view of the greek people
 the greek government have be operate in an atmosphere of chaos and extremism it have make mistake the extension of aid by this country do not mean that the united states condone everything that the greek government have do or will do we have condemn in the past and we condemn now extremist measure of the right or the left we have in the past advise tolerance and we advise tolerance now greece 's neighbor turkey also deserve our attention
 the future of turkey as an independent and economically sound state be clearly no less important to the freedom love people of the world than the future of greece the circumstance in which turkey find itself today be considerably different from those of greece turkey have be spare the disaster that have beset greece and during the war the united states and great britain furnish turkey with material aid
 nevertheless turkey now need our support
 since the war turkey have seek additional financial assistance from great britain and the united states for the purpose of effecting that modernization necessary for the maintenance of its national integrity
 that integrity be essential to the preservation of order in the middle east
 the british government have inform we that owe to its own difficulty it can no long extend financial or economic aid to turkey
 as in the case of greece if turkey be to have the assistance it need the united states must supply it we be the only country able to provide that help
 i be fully aware of the broad implication involve if the united states extend assistance to greece and turkey and i shall discuss these implication with you at this time
 one of the primary objective of the foreign policy of the united states be the creation of condition in which we and other nation will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion this be a fundamental issue in the war with germany and japan our victory be win over country which seek to impose their will and their way of life upon other nation
 to ensure the peaceful development of nation free from coercion the united states have take a leading part in establish the united nations the united nations be design to make possible last freedom and independence for all its member we shall not realize our objective however unless we be willing to help free people to maintain their free institution and their national integrity against aggressive movement that seek to impose upon they totalitarian regime this be no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian regime impose upon free people by direct or indirect aggression undermine the foundation of international peace and hence the security of the united states
 the people of a number of country of the world have recently have totalitarian regime force upon they against their will the government of the united states have make frequent protest against coercion and intimidation in violation of the yalta agreement in poland rumania and bulgaria i must also state that in a number of other country there have be similar development
 at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative way of life the choice be too often not a free one
 one way of life be base upon the will of the majority and be distinguish by free institution representative government free election guarantee of individual liberty freedom of speech and religion and freedom from political oppression
 the second way of life be base upon the will of a minority forcibly impose upon the majority it rely upon terror and oppression a control press and radio fix election and the suppression of personal freedom
 i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free people who be resist attempt subjugation by armed minority or by outside pressure
 i believe that we must assist free people to work out their own destiny in their own way
 i believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which be essential to economic stability and orderly political process
 the world be not static and the status quo be not sacred but we can not allow change in the status quo in violation of the charter of the united nations by such method as coercion or by such subterfuge as political infiltration in help free and independent nation to maintain their freedom the united states will be give effect to the principle of the charter of the united nations
 it be necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survival and integrity of the greek nation be of grave importance in a much wide situation if greece should fall under the control of an armed minority the effect upon its neighbor turkey would be immediate and serious confusion and disorder might well spread throughout the entire middle east
 moreover the disappearance of greece as an independent state would have a profound effect upon those country in europe whose people be struggle against great difficulty to maintain their freedom and their independence while they repair the damage of war
 it would be an unspeakable tragedy if these country which have struggle so long against overwhelming odd should lose that victory for which they sacrifice so much collapse of free institution and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for they but for the world discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring people strive to maintain their freedom and independence
 should we fail to aid greece and turkey in this fateful hour the effect will be far reach to the west as well as to the east
 we must take immediate and resolute action
 i therefore ask the congress to provide authority for assistance to greece and turkey in the amount of $ 400,000,000 for the period end june 30 1948 in request these fund i have take into consideration the maximum amount of relief assistance which would be furnish to greece out of the $ 350,000,000 which i recently request that the congress authorize for the prevention of starvation and suffering in country devastate by the war
 in addition to fund i ask the congress to authorize the detail of american civilian and military personnel to greece and turkey at the request of those country to assist in the task of reconstruction and for the purpose of supervise the use of such financial and material assistance as may be furnish i recommend that authority also be provide for the instruction and raining of select greek and turkish personnel
 finally i ask that the congress provide authority which will permit the speedy and most effective use in term of needed commodity supply and equipment of such fund as may be authorize
 if further fund or further authority should be need for the purpose indicate in this message i shall not hesitate to bring the situation before the congress on this subject the executive and legislative branch of the government must work together
 this be a serious course upon which we embark i would not recommend it except that the alternative be much more serious
 the united states contribute $ 341,000,000,000 toward win world war ii this be an investment in world freedom and world peace
 the assistance that i be recommend for greece and turkey amount to little more than 1/10 of 1 percent of this investment it be only common sense that we should safeguard this investment and make sure that it be not in vain
 the seed of totalitarian regime be nurture by misery and want they spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife they reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a well life have die
 we must keep that hope alive
 the free people of the world look to we for support in maintain their freedom
 if we falter in our leadership we may endanger the peace of the world and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation
 great responsibility have be place upon we by the swift movement of event
 i be confident that the congress will face these responsibility squarely

my fellow countryman
 at noon today i send to congress a message veto the taft hartley labor bill i veto this bill because i be convinced it be a bad bill it be bad for labor bad for management and bad for the country
 i have hope that the congress would send i a labor bill i could sign
 i have say before and i say it now that we need legislation to correct abuse in the field of labor relation
 last january i make specific recommendation to the congress as to the kind of labor legislation we should have immediately i urge that the congress provide for a commission to be make up of representative of the congress the public labor and management to study the entire field of labor management relation and to suggest what additional law we should have
 i believe that my proposal be accept by the great majority of our people as fair and just
 if the congress have accept those recommendation we would have today the basis for improve labor management relation i would gladly have sign a labor bill if it have take we in the right direction of stable peaceful labor relation even though it might not have be draw up exactly as i wish
 i would have sign a bill with some doubtful feature if take as a whole it have be a good bill
 but the taft hartley bill be a shocking piece of legislation
 it be unfair to the work people of this country it clearly abuse the right which million of our citizen now enjoy to join together and bargain with their employer for fair wage and fair working condition
 under no circumstance could i have sign this bill
 the restriction that this bill place on our worker go far beyond what our people have be lead to believe this be no innocent bill
 it be interesting to note that on june 4 congressman hartley on the floor of the house of representatives make the follow statement and i quote you be go to find there be more in this bill than may meet the eye
 that be a revealing description of this bill by one of its author
 there be so much more in it than the people have be lead to believe that i be sure that very few understand what the taft hartley bill would do if it should become law
 that be why i be speak to you tonight i want you to know the real meaning of this bill
 we have all be tell by its proponent that this be a moderate bill we have be tell that the bill be harsh and drastic when it be first pass by the house of representatives but that the senate have persuade the house to drop out the harsh provision and that the final bill the bill send to i be mild and moderate
 but i find no truth in the claim that the bill send to i be mild or moderate i find that the basic purpose and much of the language of the original house of representatives bill be still in the final bill in fact the final bill follow the provision of the original house bill in at least 36 separate place
 we have all be tell that the taft hartley bill be favorable to the wage earner of this country it have be claim that worker need to be save from their own folly and that this bill would provide the mean of salvation some people have call this bill the worker bill of right
 let we see what this bill really would do to our workingmen
 the bill be deliberately design to weaken labor union when the sponsor of the bill claim that by weaken union they be give right back to individual workingman they ignore the basic reason why union be important in our democracy union exist so that labor man can bargain with their employer on a basis of equality because of union the living standard of our work people have increase steadily until they be today the high in the world
 a bill which would weaken union would undermine our national policy of collective bargaining the taft hartley bill would do just that it would take we back in the direction of the old evil of individual bargaining it would take the bargaining power away from the worker and give more power to management
 this bill would even take away from our workingmen some bargaining fight which they enjoy before the wagner act be pass 12 year ago
 if we weaken our system of collective bargaining we weaken the position of every workingman in the country
 this bill would again expose worker to the abuse of labor injunction
 it would make union liable for damage suit for action which have long be consider lawful
 this bill would treat all union alike union which have fine record with long year of peaceful relation with management would be hurt by this bill just as much as the few troublemaker
 the country need legislation which will get rid of abuse we do not need and we do not want legislation which will take fundamental right away from our work people
 we have be tell that the taft hartley bill be a means by which the country can be protect from nationwide strike in vital industry the term of the bill do not support this claim
 many people be under the impression that this bill would prevent or settle a strike in the coal industry i sincerely trust that the coal operator and the miner will soon come to an agreement on the term of a contract and that there will be no interruption of coal mining but if the miner and the operator do not reach agreement and if this bill should become law it be likely that the most that could be accomplish under the complicated procedure of the bill would be postponement of a strike from july until october
 under this bill a work stoppage in the coal mine might be prevent for 80 day and then if agreement have not be reach the miner would be free to strike and it would be mandatory for the president to refer the whole matter to congress even if congress be not in session
 postpone a strike in the coal industry until the approach of winter when our need for coal be acute be certainly not the way to protect the nation against the danger of a shortage of coal
 the bill would not aid fair and early settlement of dispute in vital industry
 we have be tell by the supporter of the taft hartley bill that it would reduce industrial strife
 on the contrary i be convinced that it would increase industrial strife
 the bill would soon upset security clause in thousand of exist agreement between labor and management these agreement be mutually arrive at and furnish a satisfactory basis for relation between worker and employer they provide stability in industry with their present type of agreement outlaw by this bill the party would have to find a new basis for agreement the restriction in this bill would make the process of reach new agreement a long and bitter one
 the bill would increase industrial strife because a number of its provision deprive worker of legal protection of fundamental right they would then have no mean of protect these right except by strike
 the bill would open up opportunity for endless law suit by employer against union and by union against employer for example it would make employer vulnerable to an immense number of law suit since grievance however minor could be take into court by dissatisfied worker
 insofar as employer be concern i predict that if this bill should become law they would regret the day that it be conceive it be load with provision that would plague and hamper management it be fill with hide legal trap that would take labor relation out of the plant where they belong and place they in the court
 another defect be that in try to correct labor abuse the taft hartley bill go so far that it would threaten fundamental democratic freedom one provision undertake to prevent political contribution and expenditure by labor organization and corporation this provision would forbid a union newspaper from comment on candidate in national election it might well prevent an incorporated radio network from spend any money in connection with the national convention of a political party it might even prevent the league of women voters which be incorporate from use its fund to inform its member about the record of a political candidate
 i regard this provision of the taft hartley bill as a dangerous challenge to free speech and our free press
 one of the basic error of this bill be that it ignore the fact that over the year we have be make real progress in labor management relation we have be achieve slow but steady improvement in cooperation between employer and worker
 we must always remember that under our free economic system management and labor be associate they work together for their own benefit and for the benefit of the public
 the taft hartley bill fail to recognize these fundamental fact many provision of the bill would have the result of change employer and worker from member of the same team to opponent on contend team
 i feel deep concern about what this would do to the steady progress we have make through the year
 i fear that this type of legislation would cause the people of our country to divide into oppose group if conflict be create as this bill would create it if the seed of discord be sown as this bill would sow they our unity will suffer and our strength will be impair
 this bill do not resemble the labor legislation which i have recommend to the congress the whole purpose of this bill be contrary to the sound growth of our national labor policy
 there be still time to enact progressive constructive legislation during the present session we need such legislation to correct abuse and to further our advance in labor management relation
 we seek in this country today a formula which will treat all man fairly and justly and which will give our people security in the necessity of life
 as our generous american spirit prompt we to aid the world to rebuild we must at the same time construct a well america in which all can share equitably in the blessing of democracy
 the taft hartley bill threaten the attainment of this goal
 for the sake of the future of this nation i hope that this bill will not become law

mr. chairman mrs. roosevelt senator morse distinguished guest lady and gentleman
 i be happy to be present at the closing session of the 38th annual conference of the national association for the advancement of colored people the occasion of meet with you here at the lincoln memorial afford i the opportunity to congratulate the association upon its effective work for the improvement of our democratic process
 i should like to talk to you briefly about civil right and human freedom it be my deep conviction that we have reach a turning point in the long history of our country 's effort to guarantee freedom and equality to all our citizen recent event in the united states and abroad have make we realize that it be more important today than ever before to insure that all americans enjoy these right
 when i say all americans i mean all americans
 the civil right law write in the early year of our republic and the tradition which have be build upon they be precious to we those law be draw up with the memory still fresh in man 's mind of the tyranny of an absentee government they be write to protect the citizen against any possible tyrannical act by the new government in this country
 but we can not be content with a civil liberty program which emphasize only the need of protection against the possibility of tyranny by the government we can not stop there
 we must keep move forward with new concept of civil right to safeguard our heritage the extension of civil right today mean not protection of the people against the government but protection of the people by the government
 we must make the federal government a friendly vigilant defender of the right and equality of all americans and again i mean all americans
 as americans we believe that every man should be free to live his life as he wish he should be limit only by his responsibility to his fellow countryman if this freedom be to be more than a dream each man must be guarantee equality of opportunity the only limit to an american 's achievement should be his ability his industry and his character these reward for his effort should be determine only by those truly relevant qualifie
 our immediate task be to remove the last remnant of the barrier which stand between million of our citizen and their birthright there be no justifiable reason for discrimination because of ancestry or religion or race or color
 we must not tolerate such limitation on the freedom of any of our people and on their enjoyment of basic right which every citizen in a truly democratic society must possess
 every man should have the right to a decent home the right to an education the right to adequate medical care the right to a worthwhile job the right to an equal share in make the public decision through the ballot and the fight to a fair trial in a fair court
 we must insure that these right on equal term be enjoy by every citizen
 to these principle i pledge my full and continued support
 many of our people still suffer the indignity of insult the narrow fear of intimidation and i regret to say the threat of physical injury and mob violence prejudice and intolerance in which these evil be root still exist the conscience of our nation and the legal machinery which enforce it have not yet secure to each citizen full freedom from fear
 we can not wait another decade or another generation to remedy these evil we must work as never before to cure they now the aftermath of war and the desire to keep faith with our nation 's historic principle make the need a press one
 the support of desperate population of battle ravage country must be win for the free way of life we must have they as ally in our continue struggle for the peaceful solution of the world 's problem freedom be not an easy lesson to teach nor an easy cause to sell to people beset by every kind of privation they may surrender to the false security offer so temptingly by totalitarian regime unless we can prove the superiority of democracy
 our case for democracy should be as strong as we can make it it should rest on practical evidence that we have be able to put our own house in order
 for these compelling reason we can no long afford the luxury of a leisurely attack upon prejudice and discrimination there be much that state and local government can do in provide positive safeguard for civil right but we can not any long await the growth of a will to action in the slow state or the most backward community
 our national government must show the way
 this be a difficult and complex undertaking federal law and administrative machinery must be improve and expand we must provide the government with well tool to do the job as a first step i appoint an advisory committee on civil rights last december its member fifteen distinguished private citizen have be survey our civil right difficulty and need for several month i be confident that the product of their work will be a sensible and vigorous program for action by all of we
 we must strive to advance civil right wherever it lie within our power for example i have ask the congress to pass legislation extend basic civil right to the people of guam and american samoa so that these people can share our ideal of freedom and self government this step with other which will follow be evidence to the rest of the world of our confidence in the ability of all man to build free institution
 the way ahead be not easy we shall need all the wisdom imagination and courage we can muster we must and shall guarantee the civil right of all our citizen never before have the need be so urgent for skillful and vigorous action to bring we close to our ideal
 we can reach the goal when past difficulty face our nation we meet the challenge with inspire charter of human right the declaration of independence the constitution the bill of rights and the emancipation proclamation today our representative and those of other liberty love country on the united nations commission on human rights be prepare an international bill of rights we can be confident that it will be a great landmark in man 's long search for freedom since its member consist of such distinguished citizen of the world as mrs. franklin d. roosevelt
 with these noble charter to guide we and with faith in our heart we shall make our land a happy home for our people a symbol of hope for all man and a rock of security in a troubled world
 abraham lincoln understand so well the ideal which you and i seek today as this conference close we would do well to keep in mind his word when he say
 if it shall please the divine being who determine the destiny of nation we shall remain a united people and we will humbly seek the divine guidance make their prolong national existence a source of new benefit to themselves and their successor and to all class and condition of mankind

i be sorry that the microphone be in the way but i must leave they the way they be because i have get to be able to see what i be do as i be always able to see what i be do
 i can not tell you how very much i appreciate the honor which you have just confer upon i i shall continue to try to deserve it
 i accept the nomination
 and i want to thank this convention for its unanimous nomination of my good friend and colleague senator barkley of kentucky he be a great man and a great public servant senator barkley and i will win this election and make these republicans like it don't you forget that
 we will do that because they be wrong and we be right and i will prove it to you in just a few minute
 this convention meet to express the will and reaffirm the belief of the democratic party there have be difference of opinion and that be the democratic way those difference have be settle by a majority vote as they should be
 now it be time for we to get together and beat the common enemy and that be up to you
 we have be work together for victory in a great cause victory have become a habit of our party it have be elect four time in succession and i be convince it will be elect a fifth time next november
 the reason be that the people know that the democratic party be the people 's party and the republican party be the party of special interest and it always have be and always will be
 the record of the democratic party be write in the accomplishment of the last 16 year i do not need to repeat they they have be very ably place before this convention by the keynote speaker the candidate for vice president and by the permanent chairman
 confidence and security have be bring to the people by the democratic party farm income have increase from less than $ 2 billion in 1932 to more than $ 18 billion in 1947 never in the world be the farmer of any republic or any kingdom or any other country as prosperous as the farmer of the united states and if they do not do their duty by the democratic party they be the most ungrateful people in the world
 wage and salary in this country have increase from $ 29 billion in 1933 to more than $ 128 billion in 1947 that be labor and labor never have but one friend in politic and that be the democratic party and franklin d. roosevelt
 and i say to labor what i have say to the farmer they be the most ungrateful people in the world if they pass the democratic party by this year
 the total national income have increase from less than $ 40 billion in 1933 to $ 203 billion in 1947 the great in all the history of the world these benefit have be spread to all the people because it be the business of the democratic party to see that the people get a fair share of these thing
 this last bad 80th congress prove just the opposite for the republicans
 the record on foreign policy of the democratic party be that the united states have be turn away permanently from isolationism and we have convert the great and good of the republicans to our viewpoint on that subject
 the united states have to accept its full responsibility for leadership in international affair we have be the backer and the people who organize and start the united nations first start under that great democratic president woodrow wilson as the league of nations the league be sabotage by the republicans in 1920 and we must see that the united nations continue a strong and grow body so we can have everlaste peace in the world
 we remove trade barrier in the world which be the good asset we can have for peace those trade barrier must not be put back into operation again
 we have start the foreign aid program which mean the recovery of europe and china and the far east we institute the program for greece and turkey and i will say to you that all these thing be do in a cooperative and bipartisan manner the foreign relations committees of the senate and house be take into the full confidence of the president in every one of these move and do not let anybody tell you anything else
 as i have say time and time again foreign policy should be the policy of the whole nation and not the policy of one party or the other partisanship should stop at the water 's edge and i shall continue to preach that through this whole campaign
 i would like to say a word or two now on what i think the republican philosophy be and i will speak from action and from history and from experience
 the situation in 1932 be due to the policy of the republican party control of the government of the united states the republican party as i say a while ago favor the privileged few and not the common everyday man ever since its inception that party have be under the control of special privilege and they have completely prove it in the 80th congress they prove it by the thing they do to the people and not for they they prove it by the thing they fail to do
 now let us look at some of they just a few
 time and time again i recommend extension of price control before it expire june 30 1946 i ask for that extension in september 1945 in november 1945 in a message on the state of the union in 1946 and that price control legislation do not come to my desk until june 30 1946 on the day on which it be suppose to expire and it be such a rotten bill that i could not sign it and 30 day after that they send i one just as bad i have to sign it because they quit and go home
 they say when opa die that price would adjust themselves for the benefit of the country they have be adjust themselves all right they have go all the way off the chart in adjust themselves at the expense of the consumer and for the benefit of the people that hold the good
 i call a special session of the congress in november 1947 november 17 1947 and i set out a 10 point program for the welfare and benefit of this country among other thing standby control i get nothing congress have still do nothing
 way back 4 1/2 year ago while i be in the senate we pass a housing bill in the senate know as the wagner ellender taft bill it be a bill to clear the slum in the big city and to help to erect low rent housing that bill as i say pass the senate 4 year ago it die in the house that bill be reintroduce in the 80th congress as the taft ellender wagner bill the name be slightly change but it be practically the same bill and it pass the senate but it be allow to die in the house of representatives and they sit on that bill and finally force it out of the banking and currency committee and the rules committee take charge and it still be in the rules committee
 but desperate plea from philadelphia in that convention that meet here 3 week ago could not get that housing bill pass they pass a bill they call a housing bill which be not worth the paper it be write on
 in the field of labor we need moderate legislation to promote labor management harmony but congress pass instead that so call taft hartley act which have disrupt labor management relation and will cause strife and bitterness for year to come if it be not repeal as the democratic platform say it ought to be repeal
 on the labor department the republican platform of 1944 say if they be in power that they would build up a strong labor department they have simply tear it up only one bureau be leave that be function and they cut the appropriation of that so it can hardly function
 i recommend an increase in the minimum wage what do i get nothing absolutely nothing
 i suggest that the school in this country be crowd teacher underpaid and that there be a shortage of teacher one of our great national need be more and well school i urge the congress to provide $ 300 million to aid the states in the present educational crisis congress do nothing about it time and again i have recommend improvement in the social security law include extend protection to those not now cover and increase the amount of benefit to reduce the eligibility age of woman from 65 to 60 year congress study the matter for 2 year but could not find the time to extend or increase the benefit but they do find time to take social security benefit away from 750,000 people and they pass that over my veto
 i have repeatedly ask the congress to pass a health program the nation suffer from lack of medical care that situation can be remedie any time the congress want to act upon it
 everybody know that i recommend to the congress the civil right program i do that because i believe it to be my duty under the constitution some of the member of my own party disagree with i violently on this matter but they stand up and do it openly people can tell where they stand but the republicans all profess to be for these measure but congress fail to
 act they have enough man to do it they could have have cloture they do not have to have a filibuster they have enough people in that congress that would vote for cloture
 now everybody like to have low taxis but we must reduce the national debt in time of prosperity and when tax relief can be give it ought to go to those who need it most and not those who need it least as this republican rich man 's tax bill do when they pass it over my veto on the third try
 the first one of these be so rotten that they could not even stomach it themselves they finally do send one that be somewhat improve but it still help the rich and stick a knife into the back of the poor
 now the republicans come here a few week ago and they write a platform i hope you have all read that platform they adopt the platform and that platform have a lot of promise and statement of what the republican party be for and what they would do if they be in power they promise to do in that platform a lot of thing i have be ask they to do that they have refuse to do when they have the power
 the republican platform cry about cruelly high price i have be try to get they to do something about high price ever since they meet the first time
 now listen this be equally as bad and as cynical the republican platform come out for slum clearance and low rental housing i have be try to get they to pass that housing bill ever since they meet the first time and it be still rest in the rules committee that bill
 the republican platform favor educational opportunity and promotion of education i have be try to get congress to do something about that ever since they come there and that bill be at rest in the house of representatives
 the republican platform be for extend and increase social security benefit think of that increase social security benefit yet when they have the opportunity they take 750,000 off the social security roll
 i wonder if they think they can fool the people of the united states with such poppycock as that
 there be a long list of these promise in that republican platform if it be not so late i would tell you all about they i have discuss a number of these failure of the republican 80th congress every one of they be important two of they be of major concern to nearly every american family they fail to do anything about high price they fail to do anything about housing
 my duty as president require that i use every mean within my power to get the law the people need on matter of such importance and urgency
 i be therefore call this congress back into session july 26th
 on the 26th day of july which out in missouri we call turnip day i be go to call congress back and ask they to pass law to halt rise price to meet the housing crisis which they be say they be for in their platform
 at the same time i shall ask they to act upon other vitally need measure such as aid to education which they say they be for a national health program civil right legislation which they say they be for an increase in the minimum wage which i doubt very much they be for extension of the social security coverage and increase benefit which they say they be for fund for project need in our program to provide public power and cheap electricity by indirection this 80th congress have try to sabotage the power policy the united states have pursue for 14 year that power lobby be as bad as the real estate lobby which be sit on the housing bill
 i shall ask for adequate and decent law for displace person in place of this anti semitic anti catholic law which this 80th congress pass
 now my friend if there be any reality behind that republican platform we ought to get some action from a short session of the 80th congress they can do this job in 15 day if they want to do it they will still have time to go out and run for office
 they be go to try to dodge their responsibility they be go to drag all the red herring they can across this campaign but i be here to say that senator barkley and i be not go to let they get away with it
 now what that bad 80th congress do in this special session will be the test the american people will not decide by listen to mere word or by read a mere platform they will decide on the record the record as it have be write and in the record be the stark truth that the battle line of 1948 be the same as they be in 1932 when the nation lie prostrate and helpless as a result of republican misrule and inaction
 in 1932 we be attack the citadel of special privilege and greed we be fight to drive the money changer from the temple today in 1948 we be now the defender of the stronghold of democracy and of equal opportunity the haven of the ordinary people of this land and not of the favor class or the powerful few the battle cry be just the same now as it be in 1932 and i paraphrase the word of franklin d. roosevelt as he issue the challenge in accept nomination in chicago this be more than a political call to arm give i your help not to win vote alone but to win in this new crusade to keep america secure and safe for its own people
 now my friend with the help of god and the wholehearte push which you can put behind this campaign we can save this country from a continuation of the 80th congress and from misrule from now on
 i must have your help you must get in and push and win this election the country can not afford another republican congress

i appreciate that introduction very much and i think he be a good prophet

		 i have have a wonderful tour today begin at rock island ill. and they tell i this be the last town in iowa i will stop at and i will regret that because at every place i have be the crowd have be just like this and they have be exceedingly cordial i feel that iowa be begin to wake up to the situation and on november 2 i will not have to say much more about they vote democratic

		 you know the reason for that be that the democratic party give the farmer the price support program soil conservation rural electrification crop insurance and other progressive measure of this kind they have lead to the great prosperity for the farmer that the farmer have ever have in the history of the world

		 in 1932 123,000 farmer in the united states have lose their farm in 1947 less than 800 farm be foreclose that be the great record in history

		 in 1932 the farmer be hopelessly in debt their indebtedness have be reduce by more than 50 percent and they have $ 18 billion in asset think of that just think of that

		 now there be people in this united states that would like to go back to that condition when labor be receive an average of 45 cent an hour and when the farmer be get 3 cent for hog and 15 cent for corn and burn the corn because it be not worth the price those same people now have make an attempt to do away with the price support program which be responsible for this immense production which we have have in the last 7 year and which have keep million of people in this world alive

		 i be ask you just to read history to use your own judgment and to decide whether you want to go forward with the democratic party or whether you want to turn the clock back to the horse and buggy day with such people that make up that do nothing 80th congress

		 that congress try its level well to take all the right away from labor that congress try its level well to put the farmer back to 1932 that congress try its level good to put small business out of business for what purpose to help the big interest which they represent

		 do you know that there be more and big lobby in washington than at any time in the history of the congress of the united states some time a little later on i be go to tell you about those terrible lobby the association of manufacturers and the speculator lobby and several other that i could name right now and i have get the fact and figure on they they spend more money lobby for special privilege in this do nothing 80th congress than have be spend in washington in the whole history of the country

		 now why do they do that because they want to take you to town i will tell you you're go to get take to town if you do not use your privilege on election day

		 you stay at home in 1946 and you get the 80th congress and you get just exactly what you deserve you do not exercise your god give right to control this country now you be go to have another chance if you let that chance slip you will not have my sympathy

		 if you do not let that chance slip you will do i a very great favor for i will live in the white house another 4 year

		 it be be a very great pleasure to be in iowa and i appreciate it i have have the privilege of ride with all your public official today it be be a very great pleasure to ride with your candidate for governor who be a wonderful man the democratic candidate for governor and i be with guy gillette with whom i serve in the senate and there never be a well senator in the senate than guy gillette i be extremely fond of he and i hope for your own welfare and for the welfare of this great state that you will send guy gillette back to the senate and that you will elect the democratic candidate for governor and all the democratic congressmen and public official you possibly can i like democrats no matter what office they be run for

		 i hope that everything will go well with you i can not tell you how i appreciate this wonderful turnout this wonderful reception it be be just like this all day long i have come to the conclusion that the people in iowa like their president and appreciate what he be try to do for the common people

it certainly be a pleasure this be the first missouri town at which we have stop since we leave washington and i certainly be highly pleased when the next governor of missouri meet i in des moines this morning and spend the day with i we go to that great meeting outside of des moines and he have be with i ever since i tell he that at the first stop in missouri he be go to have to present the president of the united states although so far as missouri be concern they didn&#39;t need such a presentation

 forrest smith and i be go to carry this state and so be every other democrat on the ticket i have get a lot of friend here in trenton i have be here many a time when i be a kid i have a job in the national bank of commerce in kansas city and i be get $ 35 a month and i have an old lady who run a boarding house out on 1314 troost and she let i live there and have two meal a day for $ 5 a week imagine that and she be a native of trenton mo. that have be so long ago i hate to remember just exactly how long it have be but because that good old lady be so kind to i i have always have a warm spot in my heart for this town even if it do go republican sometimes

 i don&#39;t think you be go to do that next time how about it

 i be not suppose to address or make a political speech in my home state at this time but i sincerely hope that all of you will study the issue for what they be worth and i sincerely hope that on election day you won&#39;t hesitate to go to the poll because this government of our be make up of the people every one of you have a hand in this government and when you don&#39;t exercise that great privilege which our forefather seek to give you you be shirk your duty and then if the government go wrong there be nobody to blame but you

 gt;you know in 1946 two third of you stay at home and you have get the 80th congress&mdash;i say next to one the bad congress the country have ever have for the welfare of the public

 if you will study the record i be sure you will come to the same conclusion that i have although you be not as close to those thing as i be but your interest be involve in the result of this&mdash;the action and nonaction of the 80th congress

 all of you in this good town depend either on some job or on the soil and if you do your interest have be vitally affect by the action of this do nothing 80th republican congress

 thank you all very much

mr. vice president mr. chief justice fellow citizen
 i accept with humility the honor which the american people have confer upon i i accept it with a resolve to do all that i can for the welfare of this nation and for the peace of the world
 in perform the duty of my office i need the help and the prayer of every one of you i ask for your encouragement and for your support the task we face be difficult we can accomplish they only if we work together
 each period of our national history have have its special challenge those that confront we now be as momentous as any in the past today mark the beginning not only of a new administration but of a period that will be eventful perhaps decisive for we and for the world
 it may be our lot to experience and in a large measure bring about a major turning point in the long history of the human race the first half of this century have be mark by unprecedented and brutal attack on the right of man and by the two most frightful war in history the supreme need of our time be for man to learn to live together in peace and harmony
 the people of the earth face the future with grave uncertainty compose almost equally of great hope and great fear in this time of doubt they look to the united states as never before for good will strength and wise leadership
 it be fitting therefore that we take this occasion to proclaim to the world the essential principle of the faith by which we live and to declare our aim to all people
 the american people stand firm in the faith which have inspire this nation from the beginning we believe that all man have a right to equal justice under law and equal opportunity to share in the common good we believe that all man have a right to freedom of thought and expression we believe that all man be create equal because they be create in the image of god
 from this faith we will not be move
 the american people desire and be determined to work for a world in which all nation and all people be free to govern themselves as they see fit and to achieve a decent and satisfy life above all else our people desire and be determined to work for peace on earth a just and last peace base on genuine agreement freely arrive at by equal
 in the pursuit of these aim the united states and other like minded nation find themselves directly oppose by a regime with contrary aim and a totally different concept of life
 that regime adhere to a false philosophy which purport to offer freedom security and great opportunity to mankind mislead by that philosophy many people have sacrifice their liberty only to learn to their sorrow that deceit and mockery poverty and tyranny be their reward
 that false philosophy be communism
 communism be base on the belief that man be so weak and inadequate that he be unable to govern himself and therefore require the rule of strong master
 democracy be base on the conviction that man have the moral and intellectual capacity as well as the inalienable right to govern himself with reason and justice
 communism subject the individual to arrest without lawful cause punishment without trial and force labor as the chattel of the state it decree what information he shall receive what art he shall produce what leader he shall follow and what thought he shall think
 democracy maintain that government be establish for the benefit of the individual and be charge with the responsibility of protect the right of the individual and his freedom in the exercise of those ability of his
 communism maintain that social wrong can be correct only by violence
 democracy have prove that social justice can be achieve through peaceful change
 communism hold that the world be so widely divide into oppose class that war be inevitable
 democracy hold that free nation can settle difference justly and maintain a last peace
 these difference between communism and democracy do not concern the united states alone people everywhere be come to realize that what be involve be material well being human dignity and the right to believe in and worship god
 i state these difference not to draw issue of belief as such but because the action result from the communist philosophy be a threat to the effort of free nation to bring about world recovery and last peace
 since the end of hostility the united states have invest its substance and its energy in a great constructive effort to restore peace stability and freedom to the world
 we have seek no territory we have impose our will on none we have ask for no privilege we would not extend to other
 we have constantly and vigorously support the united nations and related agency as a means of apply democratic principle to international relation we have consistently advocate and rely upon peaceful settlement of dispute among nation
 we have make every effort to secure agreement on effective international control of our most powerful weapon and we have work steadily for the limitation and control of all armament
 we have encourage by precept and example the expansion of world trade on a sound and fair basis
 almost a year ago in company with 16 free nation of europe we launch the great cooperative economic program in history the purpose of that unprecedented effort be to invigorate and strengthen democracy in europe so that the free people of that continent can resume their rightful place in the forefront of civilization and can contribute once more to the security and welfare of the world
 our effort have bring new hope to all mankind we have beat back despair and defeatism we have save a number of country from lose their liberty hundred of million of people all over the world now agree with we that we need not have war that we can have peace
 the initiative be ours
 we be move on with other nation to build an even strong structure of international order and justice we shall have as our partner country which no long solely concerned with the problem of national survival be now work to improve the standard of living of all their people we be ready to undertake new project to strengthen a free world
 in the come year our program for peace and freedom will emphasize four major course of action
 first we will continue to give unfaltere support to the united nations and related agency and we will continue to search for way to strengthen their authority and increase their effectiveness we believe that the united nations will be strengthen by the new nation which be be form in land now advance toward self government under democratic principle
 second we will continue our program for world economic recovery
 this mean first of all that we must keep our full weight behind the european recovery program we be confident of the success of this major venture in world recovery we believe that our partner in this effort will achieve the status of self support nation once again
 in addition we must carry out our plan for reduce the barrier to world trade and increase its volume economic recovery and peace itself depend on increase world trade
 third we will strengthen freedom love nation against the danger of aggression
 we be now work out with a number of country a joint agreement design to strengthen the security of the north atlantic area such an agreement would take the form of a collective defense arrangement within the term of the united nations charter
 we have already establish such a defense pact for the western hemisphere by the treaty of rio de janeiro
 the primary purpose of these agreement be to provide unmistakable proof of the joint determination of the free country to resist armed attack from any quarter every country participate in these arrangement must contribute all it can to the common defense
 if we can make it sufficiently clear in advance that any armed attack affect our national security would be meet with overwhelming force the armed attack might never occur
 i hope soon to send to the senate a treaty respect the north atlantic security plan
 in addition we will provide military advice and equipment to free nation which will cooperate with we in the maintenance of peace and security
 fourth we must embark on a bold new program for make the benefit of our scientific advance and industrial progress available for the improvement and growth of underdeveloped area
 more than half the people of the world be live in condition approach misery their food be inadequate they be victim of disease their economic life be primitive and stagnant their poverty be a handicap and a threat both to they and to more prosperous area
 for the first time in history humanity posesse the knowledge and skill to relieve suffering of these people
 the united states be pre eminent among nation in the development of industrial and scientific technique the material resource which we can afford to use for assistance of other people be limited but our imponderable resource in technical knowledge be constantly grow and be inexhaustible
 i believe that we should make available to peace love people the benefit of our store of technical knowledge in order to help they realize their aspiration for a well life and in cooperation with other nation we should foster capital investment in area need development
 our aim should be to help the free people of the world through their own effort to produce more food more clothing more material for housing and more mechanical power to lighten their burden
 we invite other country to pool their technological resource in this undertaking their contribution will be warmly welcome this should be a cooperative enterprise in which all nation work together through the united nations and its specialized agency whenever practicable it must be a worldwide effort for the achievement of peace plenty and freedom
 with the cooperation of business private capital agriculture and labor in this country this program can greatly increase the industrial activity in other nation and can raise substantially their standard of living
 such new economic development must be devise and control to the benefit of the people of the area in which they be establish guarantee to the investor must be balance by guarantee in the interest of the people whose resource and whose labor go into these development
 the old imperialism exploitation for foreign profit have no place in our plan what we envisage be a program of development base on the concept of democratic fair dealing
 all country include our own will greatly benefit from a constructive program for the well use of the world 's human and natural resource experience show that our commerce with other country expand as they progress industrially and economically
 great production be the key to prosperity and peace and the key to great production be a wide and more vigorous application of modern scientific and technical knowledge
 only by help the least fortunate of its member to help themselves can the human family achieve the decent satisfy life that be the right of all people
 democracy alone can supply the vitalizing force to stir the people of the world into triumphant action not only against their human oppressor but also against their ancient enemy hunger misery and despair
 on the basis of these four major course of action we hope to help create the condition that will lead eventually to personal freedom and happiness for all mankind
 if we be to be successful in carry out these policy it be clear that we must have continue prosperity in this country and we must keep ourselves strong
 slowly but surely we be weave a world fabric of international security and grow prosperity
 we be aid by all who wish to live in freedom from fear even by those who live today in fear under their own government
 we be aid by all who want relief from lie and propaganda those who desire truth and sincerity
 we be aid by all who desire self government and a voice in decide their own affair
 we be aid by all who long for economic security for the security and abundance that man in free society can enjoy
 we be aid by all who desire freedom of speech freedom of religion and freedom to live their own life for useful end
 our ally be the million who hunger and thirst after righteousness
 in due time as our stability become manifest as more and more nation come to know the benefit of democracy and to participate in grow abundance i believe that those country which now oppose we will abandon their delusion and join with the free nation of the world in a just settlement of international difference
 event have bring our american democracy to new influence and new responsibility they will test our courage our devotion to duty and our concept of liberty
 but i say to all man what we have achieve in liberty we will surpass in great liberty
 steadfast in our faith in the almighty we will advance toward a world where man 's freedom be secure
 to that end we will devote our strength our resource and our firmness of resolve with god 's help the future of mankind will be assure in a world of justice harmony and peace
